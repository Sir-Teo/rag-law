=== Answer for Query C (Litigation related to the transaction) ===

Based on the proxy statement, here are the key points regarding litigation related to the Twitter merger:

1. One complaint was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery on May 6, 2022:
- Alleges Elon Musk reached an "agreement, arrangement or understanding" with other Twitter stockholders before board approval to vote in favor of the merger
- Seeks a declaration that Section 203's supermajority voting requirement applies to the merger
- Seeks an order declaring the merger is subject to Section 203 and finding board breached fiduciary duties by entering merger without supermajority vote

2. The Delaware Court of Chancery dismissed the complaint on June 27, 2022:
- Stipulated dismissal with prejudice as to the Delaware Plaintiff only
- Mr. Musk is not a party to the lawsuit

3. Another complaint was filed in Northern District of California on May 25, 2022:
- By a putative Twitter stockholder (California Plaintiff)
- Seeks declaration that Mr. Musk is not entitled to put the merger agreement on hold pending investigation of false or spam accounts
- Seeks declaration that Twitter has an obligation to investigate Mr. Musk's insider trading
- Seeks damages and declaratory relief
- Does not seek monetary damages from Twitter

4. Additional lawsuits:
- Books and records complaint filed June 7, 2022 in Delaware Court of Chancery seeking access to documents
- Stockholder lawsuit filed June 28, 2022 in Southern District of New York seeking damages and injunctive relief

5. Key litigation developments:
- On July 8, 2022 Mr. Musk delivered notice purporting to terminate the merger agreement
- On July 12, 2022 Twitter filed suit against Mr. Musk, Parent and Acquisition Sub seeking specific performance to enforce the merger agreement
- On July 19, 2022 the Delaware Court of Chancery granted Twitter's motion to expedite proceedings in this litigation

6. Remaining litigation risks:
- Ongoing litigation could delay or prevent completion of the merger
- Potential for additional lawsuits to be filed in the future
- Uncertainty around the outcome of ongoing litigation

The litigation primarily centers around challenging the legality and fairness of the merger terms, with Twitter seeking to enforce the agreement while Mr. Musk seeks to terminate it.
