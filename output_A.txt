=== Answer for Query A (Golden parachute) ===

Based on the proxy statement, here are the key points regarding the golden parachute provisions in the Twitter-Parent merger agreement:

1. Definition of "Golden Parachute Compensation"

The merger agreement defines "golden parachute compensation" as:

- Compensation that becomes payable to Twitter's named executive officers (NEOs) in connection with the merger, including:
  - Severance payments and benefits
  - Acceleration of equity vesting
  - Payments for benefits like COBRA continuation coverage
  - Other compensation or benefits that are based on or relate to the merger

2. Treatment of NEOs' equity awards

The key points regarding NEOs' equity awards are:

- Vested awards: Cancelled and converted into cash based on the merger consideration ($54.20 per share)
- Unvested awards: Cancelled and converted into cash based on the merger consideration, with vesting accelerated subject to continued employment through applicable vesting dates
- Options: Cancelled and converted into cash based on the merger consideration, with vesting accelerated similarly

3. Severance benefits

Named executive officers are eligible to receive severance payments and benefits, including:

- Lump sum payment equal to 100% of base salary
- COBRA continuation coverage premiums for up to 12 months, or taxable payments in lieu 
- Acceleration of vesting of 12.5% of unvested equity awards (with performance-based vesting deemed achieved at target levels)

4. Severance policy provisions

The severance policy applies, providing benefits for involuntary terminations within a specified period following the merger.

5. No increase in equity awards

The merger agreement states that there will be no increase in equity awards to NEOs in connection with the merger.

6. Golden Parachute Tax Mitigation

The agreement provides that if payments to an NEO would be subject to excise taxes under Section 280G and 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, such payments will be reduced if necessary to result in a better after-tax benefit to the NEO.

7. Timing

The amounts and benefits are payable upon the effective time of the merger.

8. Estimates

The amounts are estimates based on certain assumptions, including:

- September 30, 2022 as the effective date of the merger
- Involuntary termination on that date for NEOs
- A price of $54.20 per share

This outlines the key aspects of the "golden parachute" or sever
