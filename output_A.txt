Interests of Scripps’ Directors and Officers in the Transactions

Interests of Scripps’ Directors.

Except as described below, none of the directors of Scripps has any interest in the transactions different from, or in addition to, the interests of Scripps shareholders generally. No director of Scripps will become a director of Journal Media Group in connection with the transactions. Scripps restricted share units outstanding immediately prior to closing and held by Scripps’ directors (and phantom stock units credited under Scripps’ deferred compensation plan for directors) will continue in effect after the closing of the transactions in accordance with their terms, with appropriate adjustments to preserve the value of such awards. In addition, each of Scripps’ directors will receive a cash dividend-equivalent payment with respect to his or her outstanding restricted share units in connection with the Scripps special dividend, and the phantom stock units credited under Scripps’ deferred compensation plan for directors will be adjusted to reflect the payment of the Scripps special dividend.

Interests of Scripps’ Officers.

Scripps shareholders should be aware that Timothy E. Stautberg and the other executive officers of Scripps may have interests in the transactions that are different from, or are in addition to, the interests of Scripps shareholders generally. Scripps’ Board of Directors was aware of these interests during its deliberations on the merits of the transactions (to the extent such interests existed at such time) and in deciding to recommend that the Scripps shareholders vote for the approval of the Scripps amendment proposal and the Scripps share issuance proposal.

Interests of Mr. Stautberg. Mr. Stautberg is Scripps’ Senior Vice President, Newspapers and will become the President and Chief Executive Officer of Journal Media Group and a member of the Board of Directors of Journal Media Group following completion of the transactions. As a result, Mr. Stautberg’s outstanding Scripps restricted share units will become fully vested as of the closing of the transactions (to the extent not previously vested) and will be treated in the same manner as outstanding Scripps class A common shares (i.e., the restricted share units will be cancelled in exchange for a combination of Scripps class A common shares, shares of Journal Media Group common stock and a cash dividend-equivalent payment in 

105

* * *

connection with the Scripps special dividend). For a description of the employment agreement between Mr. Stautberg and Journal Media Group, see “Management of Journal Media Group” beginning on page 181. 

In addition, it is anticipated that Mr. Stautberg (and each of Scripps’ other executive officers) will receive a pro-rated target annual incentive bonus for 2015, payable in cash, based on the portion of the year ending on the closing of the transactions.

Interests of Scripps Officers Other Than Mr. Stautberg. None of Scripps’ executive officers, other than Mr. Stautberg, will become officers, directors or employees of Journal Media Group in connection with the transactions. As a result, all stock-based compensation awards outstanding immediately prior to closing held by Scripps executive officers other than Mr. Stautberg will continue in effect after the closing of the transactions in accordance with their terms, with appropriate adjustments to preserve the value of such awards. In addition, each of Scripps’ executive officers will receive a cash dividend-equivalent payment with respect to his or her outstanding restricted share units in connection with the Scripps special dividend. For a description of the treatment of equity compensation held by directors and executive officers of Scripps in the transactions, see “Master Transaction Agreement - Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards” beginning on page 127. 

It is also anticipated that each of Scripps’ executive officers (including, as noted above, Mr. Stautberg) will receive a pro-rated target annual incentive bonus for 2015, payable in cash, based on the portion of the year ending on the closing of the transactions. It is estimated that the total amount of the 2015 pro-rated target annual incentive bonuses that would be paid to Scripps’ executive officers (including Mr. Stautberg) will equal $417,816 in the aggregate, assuming that (i) the consummation of the transactions occurs on March 30, 2015, and (ii) the target annual bonus amount for each executive officer for fiscal year 2015 will be equal to the target bonus amount established for fiscal year 2014. 

It is estimated that the total amount of the cash dividend-equivalent payments to be made to Scripps’ directors and executive officers with respect to their outstanding restricted share units, plus the dividend equivalents to be credited to phantom stock accounts under Scripps’ deferred compensation plan for directors, in connection with the Scripps special dividend will equal $432,452 in the aggregate, assuming that (i) the Scripps special dividend will equal approximately $1 per share, (ii) the amount of dividend equivalents payable on restricted share units is determined based on the number of outstanding unvested restricted share units expected to be held by Scripps’ executive officers and directors as of March 30, 2015, and (iii) the amount of dividend equivalents credited to phantom stock accounts under Scripps’ deferred compensation plan for directors is determined based on the number of phantom stock units credited to such plan as of December 31, 2014.

Transaction-Related Compensation - Scripps

The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act regarding the compensation that is or may become payable to Scripps’ named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transactions. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by applicable SEC disclosure rules. 

For purposes of this table, we have assumed that the consummation of the transactions occurs on March 30, 2015.

(3)| Reflects the “single trigger” accelerated vesting of Mr. Stautberg’s unvested Scripps restricted share units as of the closing of the transactions. The amount reported with respect to Mr. Stautberg in this column was determined by multiplying the number of Mr. Stautberg’s Scripps restricted share units that had not vested as of March 30, 2015 (with performance-based restricted share units for the 2014 performance period included at target) by $21.47, the average per-share closing price of Scripps’ class A common shares over the first five business days following July 30, 2014, the date of the first public announcement of the transactions.

(4)| The amounts reported in this column represent the cash dividend equivalents payable on unvested Scripps restricted share units outstanding as of as of March 30, 2015, which would be payable on a “single-trigger” basis in connection with the Scripps special dividend. The amount reported in this column for each named executive officer is equal to the product of $1 per share (the assumed value of the Scripps special dividend) multiplied by the number of Scripps restricted share units expected to be outstanding and unvested as of the closing of the transactions.

(5)| The total estimated amount of compensation reported in this column for each of Scripps’ named executive officers is payable upon consummation of the transactions, which is referred to as a “single trigger” payment.

(6)| Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14a-21(c), other than the cash payments and benefits that may be payable to Mr. Stautberg disclosed in footnotes (2), (3) and (4), the compensation payable by Journal Media Group to Mr. Stautberg pursuant to his employment agreement is not reflected in this table because such compensation is payable by Journal Media Group in consideration for post-closing services and, accordingly, is not considered "golden parachute compensation" under Regulation S-K Item 402(t).

Titles: Journal Compensation Proposal

<a name="sCC7B4D0DF79E15A28A8050CFB0347BEF"></a>

Journal Compensation Proposal

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that Journal provide its shareholders with the opportunity to cast an advisory (non-binding) vote at the Journal special meeting on the compensation which is or may become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the transactions. Accordingly, Journal is requesting that holders of the outstanding Journal class A common stock and class B common stock consider and cast an advisory (non-binding) vote on the following resolution: 

“RESOLVED, that the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Journal named executive officers in connection with the transactions, as disclosed in the table entitled “Interests of Journal's Directors and Officers in the Transactions - Golden Parachute Compensation - Journal” on page 112, together with the accompanying narrative discussion relating to the named executive officers’ compensation and the agreements or understandings pursuant to which such compensation may be paid or become payable, as set forth in the section of this joint proxy statement/prospectus entitled “The Transactions - Interests of Journal’s Directors and Officers in the Transactions” is hereby APPROVED.” 

Vote Required for Approval. Approval of the Journal compensation proposal requires that the number of votes cast for the Journal compensation proposal exceed the number of votes cast against it. 

The vote on this proposal is a vote separate and apart from the votes to approve the Journal spin-off proposal and the Journal merger proposal. Approval of the Journal compensation proposal is not a condition to the completion of the transactions. Because the vote is advisory in nature only, it will not be binding on either Journal or Scripps regardless of whether the transactions are approved. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and are not, by their terms, subject to Journal shareholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of this advisory vote, if the Journal spin-off proposal and the Journal merger proposal are approved by the Journal shareholders and the transactions are completed, Journal’s named executive officers will receive any compensation to which they may be entitled.

Opinions of Scripps’ Financial Advisor

For purposes of this description of the opinions of Scripps’ financial advisor, we refer to the: 

|   
---|---  
•| “Scripps newspaper exchange ratio” as the 0.2500 of a share of Journal Media Group common stock to be issued in the Scripps newspaper merger for each share of Scripps Spinco common stock received by Scripps shareholders in the Scripps newspaper spin-off; and   

|   
---|---  
•| “broadcast exchange ratio” as the issuance by Scripps pursuant to the broadcast merger of 0.5176 of a Scripps class A common share to Journal shareholders for each share of Journal common stock.   

Scripps retained Wells Fargo Securities to act as its financial advisor in connection with a possible transaction involving Scripps and Journal. In connection with this engagement, the Board of Directors of Scripps requested that Wells

Fargo Securities provide its opinion as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, (i) to Scripps of the broadcast exchange ratio pursuant to the master agreement and (ii) to holders of Scripps common shares who receive shares of Scripps Spinco common stock pursuant to the Scripps newspaper spin-off of the Scripps newspaper exchange ratio in connection with the Scripps newspaper merger pursuant to the master agreement. In selecting Wells Fargo Securities as its financial advisor, Scripps considered, among other things, the fact that Wells Fargo Securities is a widely recognized investment banking firm with substantial experience advising companies in the media and communications industry and has familiarity with Scripps and Journal and has substantial experience providing strategic advisory services in similar transactions. Wells Fargo Securities, as part of its investment banking business, is continuously engaged in the evaluation of businesses and debt and equity securities in connection with mergers and acquisitions, underwritings, private placements and other securities offerings, senior credit financings, and general corporate advisory services.

On July 30, 2014, Wells Fargo Securities delivered written opinions to the Board of Directors of Scripps to the effect that, as of July 30, 2014, and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Wells Fargo Securities in connection with the opinions, the experience of its investment bankers and other factors it deemed relevant, (i) the broadcast exchange ratio pursuant to the master agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to Scripps and (ii) the Scripps newspaper exchange ratio in connection with the Scripps newspaper merger pursuant to the master agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Scripps common shares who receive shares of Scripps Spinco common stock pursuant to the Scripps newspaper spin-off.

Wells Fargo Securities provided its opinions for the information and use of the Board of Directors of Scripps in connection with its evaluation of the transactions.

In connection with its review, Wells Fargo Securities assumed and relied upon the accuracy and completeness of the financial and other information provided, discussed with or otherwise made available to it, including all accounting, tax and legal information, and Wells Fargo Securities did not make (and did not assume any responsibility for) any independent verification of such information. Wells Fargo Securities assumed, with the consent of the Board of Directors of Scripps, that neither the management of Journal nor of Scripps was aware of any facts or circumstances that would make such information inaccurate or misleading in any way meaningful to the analysis of Wells Fargo Securities. With respect to the financial forecasts and estimates utilized in Wells Fargo Securities’ analyses, including the Journal projections, the Scripps projections, the broadcast synergies projections and the newspaper synergies projections, Wells Fargo Securities assumed, with the consent of the Board of Directors of Scripps, that they were reasonably prepared and reflected the best current estimates, judgments and assumptions of the management of Scripps as to the future financial performance of Journal, the Journal newspaper business, the Journal broadcast business, Scripps, the Scripps newspaper business and the Scripps broadcast business and the synergies expected to result from the transactions. Wells Fargo Securities assumed no responsibility for, and expressed no view as to, such forecasts or estimates or the judgments or assumptions upon which they are based. Wells Fargo Securities also assumed that there were no material changes in the condition (financial or otherwise), results of operations, business or prospects of Journal, the Journal newspaper business, the Journal broadcast business, Scripps, the Scripps newspaper business or the Scripps broadcast business since the date of the last financial statements provided to Wells Fargo Securities. In arriving at its opinions, Wells Fargo Securities did not conduct any physical inspection or appraisals of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Journal, the Journal newspaper business, the Journal broadcast business, Scripps, the Scripps newspaper business or the Scripps broadcast business.

In rendering its opinions, Wells Fargo Securities assumed, with the consent of the Board of Directors of Scripps, that the final form of the master agreement, when signed by the parties thereto, would not differ from the draft reviewed by it in any respect material to its analysis or opinion, that the transactions and financings contemplated to be undertaken by Scripps in connection with the transactions would be consummated in accordance with the terms described in the master agreement and in compliance with all applicable laws, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material terms or conditions, and that in the course of obtaining any necessary legal, regulatory or third party consents or approvals for the transactions or such contemplated financings, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions would be imposed or actions would be taken that

* * *

would have an adverse effect on Journal, the Journal newspaper business, the Journal broadcast business, Scripps, the Scripps newspaper business or the Scripps broadcast business or the expected benefits of the transactions in any way meaningful to Wells Fargo Securities’ analysis. Wells Fargo Securities’ opinions were necessarily based on economic, market, financial and other conditions and the information made available to it as of the date hereof. Although subsequent developments may affect these opinions, Wells Fargo Securities does not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm these opinions.

Wells Fargo Securities’ opinions only address the fairness, from a financial point of view, (i) to Scripps of the broadcast exchange ratio pursuant to the master agreement and (ii) to holders of Scripps common shares who receive shares of Scripps Spinco common stock pursuant to the Scripps newspaper spin-off of the Scripps newspaper exchange ratio in connection with the Scripps newspaper merger pursuant to the master agreement, in each case, to the extent expressly specified in its opinions, and does not address any other terms or aspects of the transactions, including, without limitation, the form or structure of the transactions, any tax or accounting matters relating to the transactions, the allocation of the consideration in the broadcast merger between the holders of shares of Journal class A common stock and the holders of shares of Journal class B common stock or otherwise, any financing arrangements or any aspect or implication of any other agreement or arrangement entered into in connection with or contemplated by the transactions or otherwise. In addition, Wells Fargo Securities’ opinions do not address the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, any compensation to be received by any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the transactions, or class of such persons, relative to the broadcast exchange ratio or otherwise. Wells Fargo Securities’ opinions do not express any opinion as to the prices at which shares of Journal Media Group common stock, Scripps class A common shares or Journal class A common stock will trade at any time. Wells Fargo Securities’ opinions do not address the merits of the underlying decision by Scripps to enter into the master agreement or the relative merits of the transactions or contemplated financings compared with other business strategies or transactions available or that have been or might be considered by the management or the Board of Directors of Scripps or in which Scripps might engage. 

In connection with rendering its opinions, Wells Fargo Securities performed certain financial, comparative and other analyses as summarized below. This summary is not a complete description of the financial analyses performed and factors considered in connection with such opinions. In arriving at its opinions, Wells Fargo Securities made its determinations as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, (i) to Scripps of the broadcast exchange ratio pursuant to the master agreement and (ii) to holders of Scripps common shares who receive shares of Scripps Spinco common stock pursuant to the Scripps newspaper spin-off of the Scripps newspaper exchange ratio in connection with the Scripps newspaper merger pursuant to the master agreement, in each case, on the basis of various financial and comparative analyses taken as a whole. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex process and involves various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial and comparative analyses and the application of those methods to the particular circumstances. Therefore, a financial opinion is not readily susceptible to summary description.

In arriving at its opinions, Wells Fargo Securities did not attribute any particular weight to any single analysis or factor considered but rather made qualitative judgments as to the significance and relevance of each analysis and factor relative to all other analyses and factors performed and considered and in the context of the circumstances of the particular transaction. Accordingly, the analyses must be considered as a whole, as considering any portion of such analyses and factors, without considering all analyses and factors as a whole, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the process underlying such opinions. The fact that any specific analysis has been referred to in the summary below is not meant to indicate that such analysis was given greater weight than any other analysis referred to in the summary. No company, business or transaction reviewed is identical to Journal or Scripps or the transactions. An evaluation of these analyses is not entirely mathematical; rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading or other values of the companies, business segments or transactions reviewed.

In performing its analyses, Wells Fargo Securities considered industry performance, general business and economic conditions and other matters existing as of July 25, 2014, many of which are beyond the control of Journal and Scripps. None of Journal, Scripps or Wells Fargo Securities or any other person assumes responsibility if future results are different from those discussed whether or not any such difference is material. Any estimates contained in these analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than as set forth below. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or necessarily reflect the prices at which businesses or securities may actually be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the assumptions and estimates used in, and the results derived from, the following analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty.

The following is a summary of the material financial analyses provided on July 30, 2014 to the Board of Directors of Scripps by Wells Fargo Securities in connection with its opinions. Certain financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand the financial analyses, the tables must be read together 

75

* * *

with the text of each summary, as the tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of such financial analyses.

Broadcast Ownership Analysis 

Financial Analyses of the Scripps Broadcast Business

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information, equity research, and the Scripps projections, Wells Fargo Securities compared certain financial and other information and financial multiples relating to the Scripps broadcast business to corresponding financial and other information and financial multiples (pro forma for all announced and closed acquisitions) for certain publicly traded television companies that Wells Fargo Securities, using its professional judgment and expertise, deemed comparable to the Scripps broadcast business. Although none of these companies are directly comparable to the Scripps broadcast business in all respects, Wells Fargo Securities selected these companies because they are publicly traded companies with operations that, for purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to certain operations of the Scripps broadcast business. The companies included in the selected publicly traded companies analysis for the Scripps broadcast business were:

|   
---|---  
•| Gray Television, Inc.   
|   
---|---  
•| Media General, Inc.   
|   
---|---  
•| Nexstar Broadcasting Group, Inc.  
|   
---|---  
•| Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc.   

Wells Fargo Securities reviewed, among other information, enterprise values of the selected companies, calculated as market value of equity based on closing stock prices on July 25, 2014, plus face value of net debt, capital leases, preferred stock, and minority interest, as a multiple of the average of calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015 estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as “EBITDA.” Wells Fargo Securities also reviewed adjusted enterprise values of the selected companies, calculated as enterprise values as defined above plus underfunded pension and other post-retirement plan liabilities, as a multiple of the average of calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015 estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and pension and other post-retirement plan expense, which is referred to in this joint proxy statement/prospectus as “EBITDAP.”

Based on these analyses and utilizing its professional judgment and experience, Wells Fargo Securities then applied selected ranges of enterprise value and adjusted enterprise values to the average of calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015 estimated EBITDA multiples and EBITDAP multiples, respectively, of 9.5x to 10.75x, derived from the analyses of the selected companies, to the Scripps broadcast business’ average of calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015 estimated EBITDA and EBITDAP, respectively. Financial data of the selected companies were based on public filings, equity research, and common stock closing prices on July 25, 2014. Financial data of the Scripps broadcast business were based on the Scripps projections, net debt as of June 30, 2014 pro forma for the Scripps special dividend and underfunded pension and other post-retirement plan liabilities as of December 31, 2013, common stock closing prices on July 25, 2014, and other publicly available information. Based upon the Scripps broadcast business’ average of calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015 estimated EBITDA and EBITDAP, respectively, assuming fully diluted shares outstanding of 58.914 million, this analysis indicated an implied per share equity reference range for the Scripps broadcast business of $12.54 to $14.56 and $12.43 to $14.57, respectively. 

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Wells Fargo Securities conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the Scripps broadcast business for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted equity value per share as of June 30, 2014. A discounted cash flow analysis is a method of evaluating an asset using estimates of the future unlevered free cash flows generated by assets and taking into consideration the time value of money with respect to those future cash flows by calculating their “present value.” “Present value” refers to the current value of one or more future unlevered free cash flows from the asset, which is referred to as that asset’s cash flows, and is obtained by discounting those cash flows back to the present using a discount rate that takes into account macro-economic assumptions and estimates of risk, the opportunity cost of capital, capitalized returns and other appropriate factors. “Terminal value” refers to the capitalized value of all cash flows from an asset for periods beyond the final forecast period. Wells Fargo Securities calculated the value of the unlevered free cash flows that the Scripps broadcast business is expected to generate from July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2019 based on the Scripps projections. Wells Fargo Securities also calculated a range of terminal values for the Scripps broadcast business at the end of the five and a half year period ending December 31, 2019 by applying terminal multiples ranging from 9.50x to 10.75x, selected based on Wells Fargo Securities’ experience and professional judgment, to the average of calendar year 2019 and 

76

* * *

calendar year 2020 estimated EBITDAP. The unlevered free cash flows and range of terminal values were then discounted to present value using a range of discount rates from 7.50% to 9.25%, which were chosen by Wells Fargo Securities based on its experience and professional judgment taking into account an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Scripps broadcast business and comparable companies which Wells Fargo Securities deemed to be relevant to its analysis, to arrive at a range of illustrative adjusted enterprise values of the Scripps broadcast business. Wells Fargo Securities then adjusted the range of illustrative adjusted enterprise values of the Scripps broadcast business by subtracting net debt as of June 30, 2014 pro forma for the Scripps special dividend, underfunded pension and other post-retirement plan liabilities as of December 31, 2013, to arrive at a range of implied equity values for the Scripps broadcast business. Wells Fargo Securities then divided this range of implied equity values by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding of 58.914 million to arrive at an implied per share equity reference range for the Scripps broadcast business of $24.36 to $29.81.

Financial Analyses of the Journal Broadcast Business

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information and the Journal projections, Wells Fargo Securities compared certain financial and other information and financial multiples (pro forma for all announced and closed acquisitions) relating to the Journal broadcast business to corresponding financial and other information and financial multiples for certain publicly traded television and radio companies that Wells Fargo Securities, using its professional judgment and expertise, deemed comparable to the Journal broadcast business. Although none of these companies is directly comparable to the Journal broadcast business in all respects, Wells Fargo Securities selected these companies because they are publicly traded companies with operations that, for purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to certain operations of the Journal broadcast business. The television broadcasting and radio broadcasting companies included in the selected publicly traded companies analysis for the Journal broadcast business were:

Wells Fargo Securities reviewed, among other information, enterprise values and adjusted enterprise values in the case of television broadcasting, of the selected companies, calculated as market value of equity based on closing stock prices on July 25, 2014, plus face value of net debt, capital leases, preferred stock, and minority interest, (i) in the case of the selected television broadcasting companies, as a multiple of the average of calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015 estimated EBITDA, and as a multiple of the average of calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015 estimated EBITDAP, and (ii) in the case of the selected radio broadcasting companies, as a multiple of calendar year 2014 estimated EBITDA.

Based on these analyses and utilizing its professional judgment and experience, Wells Fargo Securities then applied selected ranges of enterprise value and adjusted enterprise values to the average of calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015 estimated EBITDA and EBITDAP multiples of 9.5x to 10.75x, derived from the analyses of the selected companies, to the Journal Television broadcast business’ average of calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015 estimated EBITDA and EBITDAP, and selected ranges of enterprise value to calendar year 2014 EBITDA multiples of 8.0x to 9.0x, derived from the analyses of the selected companies, to the Journal Radio broadcast business’ calendar year 2014 estimated EBITDA. Financial data of the selected companies were based on public filings, equity research, and common stock closing prices on July 25, 2014. Financial data of the Journal broadcast business were based on the Journal projections, net debt as of June 30, 2014 per Scripps management pro forma for the $10 million cash contribution to Journal Media Group, certain underfunded pension and other post-retirement plan liabilities as of December 31, 2013, common stock closing prices on July 25, 2014 and other publicly available information. Based upon the Journal broadcast business’ calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015 estimated EBITDA and EBITDAP, this analysis indicated an implied per share equity reference range for the Journal broadcast business of $9.63 to $11.31 and $9.03 to $10.77, respectively.

For each of the selected transactions, some of which are select assets of the target company and not the whole company, Wells Fargo Securities reviewed and analyzed, among other things, transaction value, (i) in the case of the selected television broadcasting transactions, as a multiple of the average of the target company’s estimated one year back- and one year forward-EBITDA, and (ii) in the case of the selected radio broadcasting transactions, as a multiple of the target company’s latest 12 months EBITDA, or, where such information was unavailable, as a multiple of the target company’s estimated EBITDA as provided in news articles and third party industry databases, such as SNL Kagan. Based on these analyses and utilizing its professional judgment and experience, Wells Fargo Securities then applied a selected range of EBITDA multiples of 9.5x to 12.0x derived from the selected transactions to the Journal Television broadcast business’ average of calendar year 2014 and calendar year 2015 estimated EBITDA, and a selected range of EBITDA multiples of 7.5x to 8.5x derived from the selected transactions to the Journal Radio broadcast business’ calendar year 2014 estimated EBITDA. Financial data of the selected transactions were based on public filings and other publicly available information at the time of announcement of the relevant transaction. Financial data of the Journal broadcast business were based on the Journal projections, net debt as of June 30, 2014 per Scripps management pro forma for the $10 million cash contribution to Journal Media Group, public filings and 

78

* * *

other publicly available information. This analysis indicated an implied per share equity reference range for Journal broadcast business of $9.47 to $12.51. 

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Wells Fargo Securities conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the Journal broadcast business for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted equity value per share as of June 30, 2014. Wells Fargo Securities calculated the value of the unlevered free cash flows that the Journal broadcast business is expected to generate from July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2019 based on the Journal projections. Wells Fargo Securities also calculated a range of terminal values for the Journal broadcast business at the end of the five and a half year period ending December 31, 2019 by applying terminal multiples ranging from 9.20x to 10.50x, selected based on Wells Fargo Securities’ experience and professional judgment, to blended estimated 2019/2020 EBITDAP. The unlevered free cash flows and range of terminal values were then discounted to present value using a range of discount rates from 7.6% to 9.4%, which were chosen by Wells Fargo Securities based on its experience and professional judgment taking into account an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Journal broadcast business and comparable companies which Wells Fargo Securities deemed to be relevant to its analysis, to arrive at a range of illustrative adjusted enterprise values of the Journal broadcast business. Wells Fargo Securities then adjusted the range of illustrative adjusted enterprise values of the Journal broadcast business by subtracting net debt as of June 30, 2014 per Scripps management pro forma for the $10 million cash contribution to Journal Media Group and certain underfunded pension and other post retirement plans as of December 31, 2013 to arrive at a range of implied equity values for the Journal broadcast business. Wells Fargo Securities then divided this range of implied equity values by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding of 51.106 million to arrive at an implied per share equity reference range for the Journal broadcast business of $11.30 to $14.08.

Relative Ownership Analysis. A relative ownership analysis measures each of the merging companies’ relative equity values to selected historical and projected operating metrics on a per share exchange ratio basis. In assessing the relative ownership analysis, Wells Fargo Securities derived values for each of the Journal broadcast business and Scripps broadcast business using the valuation methodologies, including the selected public companies analysis, selected transaction analysis, and discounted cash flow analysis, set forth above. Each of these methodologies was used to generate implied valuation ranges for the Journal broadcast business and the Scripps broadcast business. The low end of the implied exchange ratio of Journal common stock into Scripps class A common shares in the broadcast merger was calculated using the Journal broadcast business’ lowest implied equity value for the relevant metric over the Scripps broadcast business’ highest implied equity value for the relevant metric; the high end of the implied exchange ratio is calculated using the Journal broadcast business’ highest implied equity value for the relevant metric over the Scripps broadcast business’ lowest implied equity value for the relevant metric. The following table outlines the implied broadcast exchange ratios derived using each of these methodologies.

Newspaper Ownership Analysis

Financial Analyses of the Scripps Newspaper Business

Selected Publicly Traded Companies Analysis. Using publicly available information and the Scripps projections, Wells Fargo Securities compared certain financial and other information and financial multiples relating to the Scripps newspaper business to corresponding financial and other information and financial multiples for certain publicly traded newspaper companies that Wells Fargo Securities, using its professional judgment and expertise, deemed comparable to the Scripps newspaper business. Although none of these companies are directly comparable to the Scripps newspaper business in all respects, Wells Fargo Securities selected these companies because they are publicly traded companies with operations that, for purposes of this analysis, may be considered similar to certain operations of the Scripps newspaper business. The companies included in the selected publicly traded companies analysis for the Scripps newspaper business were:

|   
---|---  
•| A. H. Belo Corporation  

|

Wells Fargo Securities reviewed, among other information, enterprise values of the selected companies, calculated as market value of equity based on closing stock prices on July 25, 2014, plus face value of net debt, capital leases, preferred stock, and minority interest, and less equity investments, as a multiple of calendar year 2014 estimated “EBITDA.” 

Based on these analyses and utilizing its professional judgment and experience, Wells Fargo Securities then applied selected ranges of enterprise value/calendar year 2014 estimated EBITDA multiple of 5.0x to 6.5x, derived from the analyses of the selected companies, to the Scripps newspaper business calendar year 2014 estimated EBITDA. Financial data of the selected companies were based on public filings, equity research, and common stock closing prices on July 25, 2014. Financial

* * *

data of the Scripps newspaper business were based on the Scripps projections, common stock closing prices on July 25, 2014 and other publicly available information. Based upon the Scripps newspaper business calendar year 2014 estimated EBITDA, assuming fully diluted shares outstanding of 58.610 million, this analysis indicated an implied per share equity reference range for Scripps newspaper business of $2.18 to $2.84. 

Discounted Cash Flow Analysis. Wells Fargo Securities conducted a discounted cash flow analysis for the Scripps newspaper business for the purpose of determining an implied fully diluted equity value per share as of June 30, 2014. Wells Fargo Securities calculated the value of the unlevered free cash flows that the Scripps newspaper business is expected to generate from July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2019 based on the Scripps projections. Wells Fargo Securities also calculated a range of terminal values for the Scripps newspaper business at the end of the five and a half year period ending December 31, 2019 by applying terminal multiples ranging from 5.00x to 6.50x, selected based on Wells Fargo Securities’ experience and professional judgment, to estimated 2019 EBITDA. The unlevered free cash flows and range of terminal values were then discounted to present value using a range of discount rates from 11.0% to 12.5%, which were chosen by Wells Fargo Securities based on its experience and professional judgment taking into account an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Scripps newspaper business and comparable companies which Wells Fargo Securities deemed to be relevant to its analysis, to arrive at a range of illustrative enterprise values of the Scripps newspaper business. Since the Scripps newspaper business’ illustrative enterprise values are equivalent to its implied equity values per Scripps management’s assumption of zero debt and no qualified underfunded pension liability, Wells Fargo Securities divided this range of implied equity values by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding of 58.610 million to arrive at an implied per share equity reference range for the Scripps newspaper business of $2.33 to $2.85.

Financial Analyses of the Journal Newspaper Business

Based on these analyses and utilizing its professional judgment and experience, Wells Fargo Securities then applied selected ranges of enterprise value/calendar year 2014 estimated EBITDA multiple of 5.0x to 6.5x, derived from the analyses of the selected companies, to the Journal newspaper business calendar year 2014 estimated EBITDA. Financial data of the selected companies were based on public filings, equity research, and common stock closing prices on July 25, 2014. Financial data of the Journal newspaper business were based on the Journal projections, common stock closing prices on July 25, 2014 and other publicly available information.

* * *

a range of terminal values for the Journal newspaper business at the end of the five and a half year period ending December 31, 2019 by applying terminal multiples ranging from 5.0x to 6.5x, selected based on Wells Fargo Securities’ experience and professional judgment, to estimated 2019 EBITDA. The unlevered free cash flows and range of terminal values were then discounted to present value using a range of discount rates from 11.0% to 12.5%, which were chosen by Wells Fargo Securities based on its experience and professional judgment taking into account an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of the Journal newspaper business and comparable companies which Wells Fargo Securities deemed to be relevant to its analysis, to arrive at a range of illustrative enterprise values of the Journal newspaper business. Wells Fargo Securities then adjusted the range of illustrative enterprise values of the Journal newspaper business by adding the Journal newspaper business’ net cash of $10 million as of June 30, 2014 pro forma for the $10 million cash contribution to arrive at a range of implied equity values for the Journal newspaper business. Wells Fargo Securities then divided this range of implied equity values by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding of 51.106 million to arrive at an implied per share equity reference range for the Journal newspaper business of $2.09 to $2.50.

Relative Ownership Analysis. In assessing the relative ownership analysis, Wells Fargo Securities derived values for each of the Journal newspaper business and the Scripps newspaper business using the valuation methodologies, including the selected public companies analysis and discounted cash flow analysis, set forth above. Each of these methodologies was used to generate implied Scripps newspaper exchange ratios based on the valuation ranges for the Journal newspaper business and the Scripps newspaper business. For each methodology, the calculation assumed an exchange ratio of Journal Spinco common stock into Journal Media Group common stock in the Journal newspaper merger of 0.1950x, which is the Journal newspaper exchange ratio contemplated in the master agreement. The low end of the implied exchange ratio of Scripps Spinco common stock into Journal Media Group common stock in the Scripps newspaper merger was calculated using the Scripps newspaper business’ lowest implied equity value for the relevant metric over the Journal newspaper business’ highest implied equity value for the relevant metric; the high end of the implied exchange ratio was calculated using the Scripps newspaper business’ highest implied equity value for the relevant metric over the Journal newspaper business’ lowest implied equity value for the relevant metric. The following table outlines the implied Scripps newspaper exchange ratios derived using each of these methodologies.

Other Considerations

Wells Fargo Securities prepared the analyses described above for purposes of providing its opinions to the Board of Directors of Scripps as to the fairness, from a financial point of view, as of July 30, 2014, (i) to Scripps of the broadcast exchange ratio pursuant to the master agreement and (ii) to holders of Scripps common shares who receive shares of Scripps Spinco common stock pursuant to the Scripps newspaper spin-off of the Scripps newspaper exchange ratio in connection with the Scripps newspaper merger pursuant to the master agreement. The type and amount of consideration payable in the transactions were determined through negotiations among the Board of Directors and management of each of Scripps and Journal and their respective financial advisors.

Titles: Opinion of Journal's Financial Advisor

<a name="sC76881ED56762D295BA150CFB1E66FD3"></a>

Opinion of Journal’s Financial Advisor

Journal has retained Methuselah to act as Journal’s financial advisor in connection with the transactions. As part of this engagement, Journal’s Board of Directors requested that Methuselah evaluate the fairness, from a financial point of view, of the Journal newspaper exchange ratio and the broadcast exchange ratio provided for in the newspaper mergers and the broadcast merger, viewed as a single integrated transaction (collectively referred to as the “mergers” in this section), to holders of Journal common stock collectively as a group. On July 30, 2014, at a meeting of Journal’s Board of Directors held to evaluate the mergers, Methuselah rendered to Journal’s Board of Directors an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated July 30, 2014, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, factors and qualifications set forth in such opinion, the Journal newspaper exchange ratio and the broadcast exchange ratio provided for in the mergers, viewed as a single integrated transaction, were fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Journal common stock collectively as a group. 

The full text of Journal’s written opinion, dated July 30, 2014, to Journal’s Board of Directors, which sets forth, among other things, the procedures followed, assumptions made, matters considered and qualifications and limitations on the scope of review undertaken by Methuselah in connection with its opinion, is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex E and is incorporated into this joint proxy statement/prospectus by reference. The description of Methuselah’s 

87

* * *

opinion set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such opinion. Methuselah’s engagement and its opinion were for the benefit of Journal’s Board of Directors (in its capacity as such) and Methuselah’s opinion was rendered to Journal’s Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of the mergers from a financial point of view and did not address any other aspects of the mergers. Methuselah’s opinion did not address the merits of the underlying decision of Journal to engage in the mergers or related transactions or alternative business strategies in which Journal might engage. Methuselah’s opinion was not intended to and does not constitute a recommendation to any shareholder as to how such shareholder should vote or act with respect to the mergers, any related transactions or any other matter.

In connection with its opinion, Methuselah:

|   
---|---  
•| conducted such other financial studies, analyses and investigations as Methuselah deemed appropriate.  

Methuselah’s opinion, as set forth in its written opinion, dated July 30, 2014, to Journal’s Board of Directors, related to the relative values of Journal’s newspaper business and Scripps’ newspaper business and the relative values of Journal’s broadcast business and Scripps’ broadcast business. Methuselah evaluated Journal’s businesses, Scripps’ businesses and the mergers for purposes of Methuselah’s analyses and opinion after giving effect to the related transactions. Methuselah assumed and relied, with the consent of Journal, upon the accuracy and completeness of all information provided to or reviewed by Methuselah, without independent verification of such information. With respect to the financial forecasts utilized in Methuselah’s analyses, Methuselah assumed, with the consent of Journal, that they were reasonably prepared on bases reflecting the best currently available estimates and good faith judgments of the managements of Journal and Scripps as to the future financial performance of Journal’s businesses and Scripps’ businesses, the projected cost savings and other benefits anticipated by the managements of Journal and Scripps to be realized from the mergers and the other matters covered thereby. In addition, Methuselah assumed, with the consent of Journal, that such financial forecasts, including such projected cost savings and other benefits, will be realized in the amounts and at the times contemplated thereby. Methuselah assumed no responsibility for and expressed no view as to such forecasts or the assumptions on which they were based. Methuselah relied, with the consent of Journal, upon the assessments of the managements of Journal and Scripps as to (i) the related transactions, including with respect to the timing thereof and assets, liabilities and financial and other terms involved, (ii) the ability to integrate Journal’s businesses and Scripps’ businesses, (iii) Journal’s and Scripps’ existing and future relationships, agreements and arrangements with, and ability to attract and retain, networks, cable and other content distribution systems and customers and (iv) market and other trends and prospects for, and governmental and other regulatory and legislative matters relating to or affecting, the newspaper publishing and distributing industry or the television or radio industries, including the assumptions of the managements of Journal and Scripps as to, among others, competition and expected performance of participants in such industries and related markets, fluctuations in advertising spending and volume, changes in technology and evolving approaches to content distribution and industry standards. Methuselah assumed, with the consent of Journal, that there would 

88

* * *

be no developments with respect to any such matters that would be meaningful in any respect to Methuselah’s analyses or opinion.

In rendering its opinion, Methuselah assumed, with the consent of Journal, that the mergers and related transactions would be consummated on the terms described in the master agreement, without any waiver or modification of any material terms or conditions by the parties thereto. Methuselah also assumed, with the consent of Journal, that obtaining the necessary regulatory or third party approvals and consents for the mergers and related transactions (including related expenses and any required divestitures) would not have an adverse effect on Journal Media Group, Journal, Scripps (or any of their respective businesses), the mergers or related transactions (including the contemplated benefits thereof). Methuselah further assumed, with the consent of Journal, that the mergers and related transactions would qualify, as applicable, for the intended tax treatment contemplated by the master agreement. Methuselah assumed, with the consent of Journal, that each of Journal Media Group, Journal and Scripps would retain or acquire, as the case may be, all assets, properties and rights necessary for their respective businesses and operations, that appropriate reserves, indemnification arrangements or other provisions were made with respect to the liabilities of or relating to their respective businesses and operations and that none of Journal Media Group, Journal or Scripps would directly or indirectly assume any liabilities contemplated to be excluded by such entity as a result of the mergers and related transactions. Methuselah was advised, and it assumed, that the draft agreement, when executed, would be substantially similar in all material respects to the draft agreement. 

Methuselah’s opinion was necessarily based on economic, monetary, market and other conditions as in effect on, and the information made available to Methuselah as of, the date of its opinion. Methuselah assumed no responsibility for updating or revising its opinion based on circumstances or events occurring after the date of its opinion. Methuselah did not conduct any independent valuation or appraisal of any of the assets or liabilities (contingent or otherwise) of Journal, Scripps, Journal Media Group or any other entity or concerning the solvency or fair value of Journal, Scripps, Journal Media Group or any other entity, and Methuselah was not furnished with any such valuations or appraisals. Methuselah did not express any opinion as to what the actual value of Journal Media Group common stock or Scripps class A common shares would be when issued in the mergers or the prices at which shares of Journal common stock, Scripps common shares, Journal Media Group common stock or any other securities of Journal, Scripps or Journal Media Group would trade or otherwise be transferable at any time. Methuselah also did not express any opinion as to any tax or other consequences that might result from the mergers or related transactions, nor did Methuselah’s opinion address any other tax or legal, regulatory or accounting matters, as to which Methuselah understood that Journal and Scripps obtained such advice as Journal and Scripps deemed necessary from qualified professionals. In connection with its engagement, Methuselah was not requested to, and it did not, undertake a third-party solicitation process on Journal’s behalf with respect to the acquisition of all or a part of Journal. Methuselah’s opinion addressed only the fairness, from a financial point of view and as of the date of its opinion, of the Journal newspaper exchange ratio and the broadcast exchange ratio (to the extent expressly specified in its opinion) provided for in the mergers, viewed as a single integrated transaction, to holders of Journal common stock collectively as a group, as if Journal class A common stock and Journal class B common stock were a single class, without regard to individual circumstances of specific holders with respect to control, voting, liquidity or other rights or aspects which may distinguish such holders or the securities of Journal held by such holders and Methuselah’s analyses and opinion did not address, take into consideration or give effect to, any rights, preferences, restrictions or limitations (or any discount or premium for illiquidity, control or otherwise) that may be attributable to such securities nor did Methuselah’s opinion in any way address proportionate allocation or relative fairness. 

Methuselah’s opinion did not address, and Methuselah expressed no view or opinion as to, any terms or other aspects of the mergers or related transactions (other than the Journal newspaper exchange ratio and the broadcast exchange ratio to the extent expressly specified in its opinion), including, without limitation, the form or structure of the mergers, the form or structure, or financial or other terms, of any related transactions, or any terms, aspects or implications of any related agreements or any other agreements or arrangements entered into, amended or terminated in connection with, or otherwise contemplated by, the mergers, the related transactions or otherwise. In addition, Methuselah expressed no opinion as to the fairness of the amount or nature of, or any other aspects relating to, the compensation to any officers, directors or employees of any parties to the mergers or related transactions, or class of such persons, relative to the Journal newspaper exchange ratio, the broadcast exchange ratio or otherwise. The issuance of Methuselah’s opinion was approved by an authorized committee of Methuselah. Except as described in this summary, Journal imposed no instructions or limitations on the investigations made or procedures followed by Methuselah in rendering its opinion. 

In preparing its opinion to Journal’s Board of Directors, Methuselah performed a variety of financial and comparative analyses. The following is a brief summary of the material financial and comparative analyses that Methuselah deemed to be appropriate for this type of transaction and that were reviewed with Journal’s Board of Directors by Methuselah in connection with rendering its opinion. The summary of Methuselah’s financial analyses described below is not a complete description of the analyses underlying its opinion. The preparation of a financial opinion is a complex analytical process involving various determinations as to the most appropriate and relevant methods of financial analysis and the application of those methods to the

particular circumstances and, therefore, is not readily susceptible to partial or summary description. In arriving at its opinion, Methuselah considered the results of all of the analyses undertaken by it and assessed as a whole and did not draw, in isolation, conclusions from or with regard to any one factor or method of analysis considered by it. Rather, Methuselah made its determination as to fairness on the basis of its experience and professional judgment after considering the results of all of the analyses. Accordingly, Methuselah believes that its financial analyses must be considered as a whole and that selecting portions of its analyses and factors or focusing on information presented in tabular format, without considering all analyses and factors or the narrative description of the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of the processes underlying its analyses and opinion.

In its financial analyses, Methuselah considered industry performance, general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, many of which are beyond the control of Journal and Scripps. No company or transaction used in Methuselah’s analyses is identical to Journal, Scripps, Journal Media Group or the mergers and related transactions, and an evaluation of the results of those analyses is not entirely mathematical. Rather, the analyses involve complex considerations and judgments concerning financial and operating characteristics and other factors that could affect the public trading, acquisition or other values of the companies and transactions analyzed. The estimates contained in Methuselah’s analyses and the ranges of valuations resulting from any particular analysis are not necessarily indicative of actual values or predictive of future results or values, which may be significantly more or less favorable than those suggested by the analyses. In addition, analyses relating to the value of businesses or securities do not purport to be appraisals or to reflect the prices at which businesses or securities actually may be sold or acquired. Accordingly, the estimates used in, and the results derived from, Methuselah’s analyses are inherently subject to substantial uncertainty. 

The consideration payable in the mergers was determined through negotiations between Journal and Scripps and was approved by Journal’s Board of Directors. Methuselah was not requested to, and it did not, recommend the specific consideration payable in the proposed mergers or that any given consideration constituted the only appropriate consideration for the mergers. The decision to enter into the master agreement was solely that of Journal’s Board of Directors and Methuselah’s opinion and financial analyses were only one of many factors taken into consideration by Journal’s Board of Directors in its evaluation of the mergers. Consequently, the analyses described above should not be viewed as determinative of the views of Journal’s Board of Directors or management with respect to the mergers or the exchange ratios provided for in the mergers or as to whether Journal’s Board of Directors would have been willing to determine that a different consideration was fair.

The financial analyses summarized below include information presented in tabular format. In order to fully understand Methuselah’s financial analyses, the tables must be read together with the text of each summary. The tables alone do not constitute a complete description of the financial analyses. Considering the data in the tables below without considering the full narrative description of the financial analyses, including the methodologies and assumptions underlying the analyses, could create a misleading or incomplete view of Methuselah’s financial analyses. Financial data utilized for Journal’s newspaper business and Journal’s broadcast business in the financial analyses described below were based on internal financial forecasts and other data of the management of Journal, referred to as Journal broadcast business management forecasts and Journal newspaper business management forecasts, respectively, and financial data utilized for Scripps’ newspaper business and Scripps’ broadcast business in such analyses were based on internal financial forecasts and other data of the management of Scripps, as approved by the management of Journal, referred to as Scripps broadcast business management forecasts and Scripps newspaper business management forecasts, respectively. For purposes of the analyses described below, (i) implied exchange ratio reference ranges were calculated by dividing the total number of fully-diluted shares of Journal Media Group (after giving effect to a 4-to-1 reverse share split) or Scripps, as applicable, on a pro forma basis as of July 25, 2014 by the total number of fully-diluted shares of Journal as of July 25, 2014 and multiplying such quotient by the applicable implied range of contributed equity values by Journal to Scripps on a pro forma basis described below, (ii) the low-end of implied exchange ratio reference ranges was calculated by dividing the low-end of the approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Journal by the sum of the low-end of the approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Journal and the high-end of the approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Scripps and (iii) the high-end of implied exchange ratio reference ranges was calculated by dividing the high-end of the approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Journal by the sum of the high-end of the approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Journal and the low-end of the approximate implied per share equity value reference ranges for Scripps.

Broadcast Merger

Discounted Cash Flow Analyses. Methuselah performed discounted cash flow analyses of each of Journal’s broadcast business and Scripps’ broadcast business in which Methuselah calculated the estimated present value of the standalone unlevered free cash flows that Journal’s broadcast business and Scripps’ broadcast business were each forecasted to generate during the calendar years ending December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2019. Financial data of Journal’s broadcast

business was based on Journal broadcast business management forecasts and financial data of Scripps’ broadcast business was based on Scripps broadcast business management forecasts. For purposes of these analyses, stock-based compensation was treated as a cash expense. Terminal values for Journal’s broadcast business and Scripps’ broadcast business were calculated by applying to the average of the calendar years 2019 and 2020 estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, referred to as EBITDA, of Journal’s broadcast business and Scripps’ broadcast business a selected range of EBITDA multiples of 9.0x to 10.0x and 10.0x to 11.0x, respectively. The present values (as of June 30, 2014) of the cash flows and terminal values were then calculated using discount rates ranging from 8.5% to 9.5% in the case of Journal’s broadcast business and 7.5% to 8.5% in the case of Scripps’ broadcast business. These analyses indicated an approximate implied equity value reference range for Journal’s broadcast business and Scripps’ broadcast business of $666 million to $768 million and $2.110 billion to $2.379 billion, respectively. 

Based on these analyses, Methuselah calculated the following implied exchange ratio reference range, as compared to the broadcast exchange ratio:  

---  
|   
Implied Exchange Ratio Reference Range| BroadcastExchange Ratio  
0.3651x - 0.4457x| 0.5176x  

Methuselah noted that the above equity value reference ranges implied a range of contributed equity values by Journal to Scripps on a pro forma basis of approximately 21.9% to 26.7% as compared to the pro forma ownership of holders of Journal common stock in Scripps upon consummation of the broadcast merger of approximately 31%.

Selected Public Companies Analyses. Methuselah performed selected public companies analyses of Journal’s broadcast business and Scripps’ broadcast business in which Methuselah reviewed certain financial and stock market information, as applicable, relating to Journal’s broadcast business, Scripps’ broadcast business and selected companies that Methuselah in its professional judgment deemed generally relevant for comparative purposes. Financial data of the selected companies were based on public filings and other publicly available information. Financial data of Journal’s broadcast business was based on Journal broadcast business management forecasts and financial data of Scripps’ broadcast business was based on Scripps broadcast business management forecasts.

THE MASTER TRANSACTION AGREEMENT

<a name="s16C86535154FEE52273150CFB3C4427F"></a>

General

This section of the joint proxy statement/prospectus describes certain material terms of the master agreement. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the master agreement, which is incorporated by reference and attached as Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus. We urge you to read the entire master agreement. We also urge you to review Annex A to this joint proxy statement/prospectus detailing the series of transactions involved in the separation and combination of the Scripps and Journal newspaper businesses and the combination of their broadcast businesses. 

The master agreement and the discussion under this heading have been included to provide you with information regarding the terms of the master agreement. They are not intended to provide any factual information about Scripps, Journal or Journal Media Group, or any of the other parties to the master agreement. That information can be found elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus and in the other public filings made by Scripps and Journal with the SEC, which are available without charge at www.sec.gov. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 207.

Description of the Master Transaction Agreement

Pursuant to the master agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of each of Scripps and Journal, Scripps and Journal will, through a series of transactions and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified conditions, (i) separate Journal’s newspaper business pursuant to a spin-off of Journal Spinco to the shareholders of Journal, (ii) separate Scripps’ newspaper business pursuant to a spin-off of Scripps Spinco to the shareholders of Scripps, (iii) combine these two spun-off newspaper businesses through two mergers, resulting in each of them becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Journal Media Group and (iv) then merge Journal with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of Scripps. Upon consummation, the transactions will result in two separate public companies: one, Journal Media Group, continuing the combined newspaper businesses of Journal and Scripps; and the other, Scripps, continuing the combined broadcast businesses of Journal and Scripps. In connection with the transactions, each share of Journal class A common stock and Journal class B common stock outstanding on the share exchange record date will receive 0.5176 Scripps class A common shares and 0.1950 shares of Journal Media Group common stock, and each Scripps class A common share and common voting share outstanding will receive 0.2500 shares of Journal Media Group common stock. Immediately following completion of the transactions, holders of Journal’s common stock will own approximately 41% of the common stock of Journal Media Group and approximately 31% of the common shares of Scripps, in the form of Scripps class A common shares, and holders of Scripps class A common shares and common voting shares will own approximately 59% of the common stock of Journal Media Group and approximately 69% of the common shares of Scripps, in the form of Scripps class A common shares and Scripps common voting shares. Pursuant to the Master Agreement, prior to the completion of the transactions, Journal will contribute to Journal Spinco $10.0 million in cash (which will be an asset of Journal Media Group following completion of the transactions), and Scripps will distribute a special cash dividend in the aggregate amount of $60.0 million to the holders of its common shares. The transactions are intended to be tax-free at both the shareholder and corporate levels at each of Scripps and Journal, with the exceptions of the distribution of Journal Spinco to Journal shareholders, which will be taxable at the Journal corporate level, and the distribution of the Scripps special dividend to its shareholders (and Scripps employees and directors holding restricted stock units and phantom stock units that are treated as common share equivalents for purposes of the Scripps special dividend), which may be taxable to such shareholders and will be taxable to such employees and directors as compensation. 

Scripps Internal Transactions

The Scripps newspaper business currently is operated primarily through (i) Scripps Media, which owns 11 of the daily newspapers published by Scripps; (ii) Memphis Publishing Company, which publishes the Memphis Commercial Appeal; and (iii) Evansville Courier Company, Inc., which publishes the Evansville Courier. Prior to the Scripps newspaper spin-off, Scripps Media will contribute all of the assets and liabilities, with certain exceptions, related to the newspapers it publishes and certain investments (including its 40% partnership interest in a general partnership that publishes the Albuquerque Journal daily newspaper) to Scripps Newspapers LLC, and following that contribution will contribute the ownership interest in Scripps Newspaper LLC to Scripps Spinco, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Scripps Media. Following that contribution to Scripps Spinco, Scripps Media will distribute the stock of Scripps Spinco to Scripps, the sole shareholder of Scripps Media, and Scripps will then contribute to Scripps Spinco all of the outstanding stock it owns in Memphis Publishing Company and Evansville Courier Company, Inc. As a result of the foregoing, Scripps Spinco will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Scripps, and Scripps Spinco in turn will have three wholly-owned subsidiaries, Scripps Newspapers LLC, Memphis Publishing Company and Evansville Courier Company, Inc. 

125

Journal Internal Transactions

Journal’s newspapers business is currently operated through two wholly-owned subsidiaries: Journal Sentinel, Inc. and Journal Community Publishing Group, Inc. Prior to the Journal newspaper spin-off, Journal will contribute to its wholly owned subsidiary Journal Spinco, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Journal Sentinel, all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Journal Community Publishing, and cash in the amount of $10 million.

Consideration in the Newspaper Mergers

In the newspaper mergers, each Journal shareholder will receive 0.1950 shares of Journal Media Group common stock for each share of Journal class A common stock and Journal class B common stock, and each Scripps shareholder will receive 0.2500 shares of Journal Media Group common stock for each Scripps class A common share and Scripps common voting share. Immediately following completion of the newspaper mergers, Journal shareholders will own approximately 41% of the common stock of Journal Media Group, and Scripps shareholders will own approximately 59% of the common stock of Journal Media Group. 

Consideration in the Broadcast Merger

At the effective time of the broadcast merger, each outstanding share of Journal class A common stock and Journal class B common stock (other than (i) shares held by Journal, Scripps or their respective subsidiaries, and (ii) Journal class B common stock, if any, with respect to which the holders thereof have properly demanded and have not withdrawn or waived their right to dissent) will be converted into the right to receive 0.5176 class A common shares of Scripps. Immediately following completion of the broadcast merger, Journal shareholders will own approximately 31% of the common shares of Scripps, in the form of class A common shares, and Scripps shareholders will own approximately 69% of the common shares of Scripps, in the form of class A common shares and common voting shares. 

Treatment of Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards

Scripps. Scripps stock options and phantom stock units outstanding immediately prior to closing, regardless of the holder thereof, will continue in effect after the closing of the transactions in accordance with their terms, with appropriate adjustments to preserve the value of such awards. Scripps restricted share units outstanding immediately prior to closing held by Scripps broadcast and corporate employees and Scripps directors will continue in effect after the closing of the transactions in accordance with their terms, with appropriate adjustments to preserve the value of such awards. Scripps restricted share units outstanding immediately prior to the closing held by Scripps newspaper employees (including Timothy E. Stautberg) and certain terminating employees will become fully vested (to the extent not previously vested) and will be treated in the same manner as outstanding shares of Scripps class A common shares (i.e., the restricted share units will be cancelled and the holders thereof will receive a combination of Scripps class A common shares, shares of Journal Media Group common stock, and a cash dividend-equivalent payment in connection with the Scripps special dividend). In connection with the Scripps special dividend, cash dividend equivalent payments will be made to all holders of Scripps restricted share units outstanding immediately prior to closing, and the phantom stock units credited under Scripps’ deferred compensation plan for directors will be adjusted to reflect the payment of the Scripps special dividend.

Journal. Journal’s restricted stock awards outstanding immediately prior to the closing will become fully vested and will participate in the transactions on the same basis as other Journal shareholders. Journal’s stock appreciation rights (SARs) and performance units outstanding immediately prior to the closing will be cancelled and the holders thereof will receive a cash payment of the estimated fair value, with respect to the SARs, and a combination of Scripps class A common shares and shares of Journal Media Group common stock (on the same basis as other Journal shareholders), with respect to the performance units.

Certain Representations and Warranties

The representations and warranties in the master agreement were made as of specific dates. The assertions embodied in those representations and warranties were made solely for purposes of the master agreement and may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by Scripps and Journal in connection with negotiating the terms of the master agreement. Subject to certain exceptions, these representations and warranties are qualified by information disclosed by Scripps or Journal, respectively, in public reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which we refer to as the “SEC,” prior to the date of the master agreement, excluding any risk factor disclosures, disclosure of risks in any “forward-looking statements” disclaimer and any other statements that are similarly predictive or forward-looking in nature. Certain representations and warranties may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date because they are subject to a contractual standard of materiality (including, in many cases, a “material adverse effect standard”) and in some cases may be qualified by disclosures made by one party to the other in schedules delivered by such party to the other for the purpose of allocating risk between Scripps and Journal rather than establishing matters as facts. Finally, information concerning the subject matter of the representations and warranties in the master agreement may have changed since the date of the master agreement, which may or may not be fully reflected in public disclosures. Scripps and Journal will provide additional disclosure in their public reports to the extent that they are aware of the existence of any material facts that are required to be disclosed under federal securities laws and that might otherwise contradict the terms and information contained in the master agreement, and will update such disclosure as required by federal securities laws. The representations and warranties in the master agreement

For purposes of the master agreement, a “material adverse effect” with respect to a party and its subsidiaries is defined to mean a material adverse effect on the business, condition, assets, or results of operations of the newspaper business or broadcast business of the party.

|   
---|---  
•| changes or conditions generally affecting the newspaper or broadcast industry, but only to the extent the effect on one party’s newspaper or broadcast business is not materially worse than the effect on such business of the other party;   

|   
---|---  
•| changes in general economic, regulatory or political conditions, but only to the extent that the effect on the newspaper or broadcast business of one party is not materially worse than the effect on such business of the other party;

•| take any action (not otherwise permitted under the master agreement) that would make any representation or warranty inaccurate in any material respect.   

Restrictions on Journal’s Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals

On July 30, 2014, Journal was required to cease all then existing discussions with any other person relating to alternative acquisition proposals or inquiries. In addition, Journal agreed that it will not, and will not authorize or permit its subsidiaries or its subsidiaries’ representatives to, directly or indirectly:

|   
---|---  
•| solicit, initiate or take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Journal acquisition proposal (as defined below);  

|   
---|---  
•| enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with or otherwise cooperate with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, or furnish any information relating to Journal or any of its subsidiaries, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Journal or any of its subsidiaries to, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, a Journal acquisition proposal; or   

|   
---|---  
•| enter into any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding or other similar instrument relating to a Journal acquisition proposal.   

130

* * *

Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, which we refer to as the “no-shop obligations,” if Journal receives a Journal acquisition proposal prior to receiving the approval of the transactions by its shareholders, Journal may (i) provide information to such person following such person’s execution of a confidentiality agreement no less favorable to Journal than the confidentiality agreement executed by Scripps and (ii) enter into negotiations with such person regarding such person’s acquisition proposal, provided that:

|   
---|---  
•| such acquisition proposal did not result from a breach of Journal’s no-shop obligations;  

|   
---|---  
•| Journal’s Board of Directors concludes in good faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with a nationally recognized financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Journal superior proposal;  

|   
---|---  
•| Journal’s Board of Directors concludes in good faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failing to provide such information and enter into negotiations would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law; and  

|   
---|---  
•| Journal gives Scripps notice prior to taking any such actions, and provides Scripps with the name of the person making the acquisition proposal, a summary of the material terms and conditions of such proposal, and any non-public information it provides to such person if not previously provided to Scripps.   

Journal’s Board of Directors may not (i) modify or withdraw or refuse to make to shareholders its recommendation of the transactions or qualify it in a manner adverse to Scripps, (ii) approve or recommend an alternative acquisition proposal for Journal or (iii) approve or recommend, or enter into any agreement in respect of, an acquisition proposal for Journal unless such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal that did not result from a breach of Journal’s no-shop obligations, and unless the Journal board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to change its recommendation or enter into such acquisition agreement would reasonably likely violate its fiduciary obligations under applicable law. If Journal takes any of the aforesaid actions, it must provide written notice to Scripps specifying the material terms and conditions of the superior proposal, identifying the person making such proposal and indicating that the Journal board intends to make a change in its recommendation. Additionally, Journal must give Scripps the opportunity to match the superior proposal within five business days of notifying it of such proposal. 

A “Journal acquisition proposal” means, other than the transactions, any offer or proposal relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any direct or indirect (i) acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Journal and its subsidiaries (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Journal or any committee thereof), or assets comprising 15% or more of the consolidated revenues of Journal and its subsidiaries, including in any such case through the acquisition of one or more subsidiaries of Journal owning such assets, (ii) acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Journal or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of Journal and its subsidiaries, (iii) tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, could result in any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Journal or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of Journal and its subsidiaries, (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Journal, or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of Journal and its subsidiaries or (v) other transaction the completion of which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay the transactions. 

A “Journal superior proposal” means any bona fide, unsolicited written Journal acquisition proposal made by a third party that the Journal board in good faith determines, after having received the advice of a nationally recognized financial advisor and outside legal counsel, taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other terms of the proposal and the person making the proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to and expected timing and risks of consummation, the form of consideration offered and the ability of the person making such Journal acquisition proposal to obtain financing, and any changes to the terms of the master agreement proposed by Scripps in response to such offer or proposal or otherwise, to be more favorable, including without limitation from a financial point of view, to Journal and the Journal shareholders than the transactions, is reasonably likely to be consummated, and for which financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or is reasonably determined by the Journal board to be attainable. For purposes of the definition of “Journal superior proposal,” (A) each reference to “15% or more” or “more than 15%” in the definition of “Journal acquisition proposal” is replaced with “100%,” (B) clauses (ii) and (iii) of the definition of “Journal 

131

* * *

acquisition proposal” shall be read without the references to “any class of equity or” and (C) “100% of the voting securities of” is added immediately preceding the first reference to “Journal” in clause (iv) of the definition of “Journal acquisition proposal.” The effect of these alterations of percentages for purposes of the definition of Journal superior proposal is to require a superior proposal to constitute an offer for all, and not less than all, of Journal’s businesses. 

Change of Recommendation by Journal’s Board of Directors 

Journal’s Board of Directors may change its recommendation in connection with a superior proposal, prior to the approval of the transactions by Journal shareholders, if:

|   
---|---  
•| Journal receives a Journal superior proposal that did not result from a violation of its no-shop obligations;  

|   
---|---  
•| Journal’s Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably likely violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law;  

|   
---|---  
•| Journal provides five business days prior notice to Scripps that it intends to take such action and the reasons for such action;

---|---  
•| to the extent requested by Scripps during the applicable notice period, Journal negotiates in good faith with Scripps with respect to any counter offer Scripps makes to match such acquisition proposal; and

---|---  
•| Journal’s Board of Directors continues to believe, following any such negotiations with Scripps, in its good faith judgment, after having received the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal.  

Scripps may terminate the master agreement following a change of recommendation by Journal’s Board of Directors, and in such event, Journal will be required to pay Scripps a termination fee of approximately $15.8 million, plus expenses up to $7.5 million.

|   
---|---  
•| Journal pays Scripps a termination fee of approximately $15.8 million upon termination, plus expenses up to $7.5 million.  

Restrictions on Scripps’ Solicitation of Acquisition Proposals

On July 30, 2014, Scripps was required to cease all then existing discussions with any other person relating to alternative acquisition proposals or inquiries. In addition, Scripps agreed that it will not, and will not authorize or permit its subsidiaries or its subsidiaries’ representatives to, directly or indirectly:

132

* * *

|   
---|---  
•| solicit, initiate or take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Scripps acquisition proposal (as defined below);   

|   
---|---  
•| enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with or otherwise cooperate with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, or furnish any information relating to Scripps or any of its subsidiaries, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Scripps or any of its subsidiaries to, any third party that is seeking to make, or has made, a Scripps acquisition proposal; or   

|   
---|---  
•| enter into any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding or other similar instrument relating to a Scripps acquisition proposal.   

Notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions, which we refer to as the “no-shop obligations,” if Scripps receives a Scripps acquisition proposal prior to receiving the approval of the transactions by its shareholders, Scripps may (i) provide information to such person following such person’s execution of a confidentiality agreement no less favorable to Scripps than the confidentiality agreement executed by Journal and (ii) enter into negotiations with such person regarding such person’s acquisition proposal, provided that:

|   
---|---  
•| such acquisition proposal did not result from a breach of Scripps’ no-shop obligations;  

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps’ Board of Directors concludes in good faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with a nationally recognized financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Scripps superior proposal;  

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps’ Board of Directors concludes in good faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failing to provide such information and enter into negotiations would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the board’s fiduciary duties under applicable law;  

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps gives Journal notice prior to taking any such actions, and provides Journal with the name of the person making the acquisition proposal, a summary of the material terms and conditions of such proposal, any non-public information it provides to such person if not previously provided to Journal.   

Scripps’ Board of Directors may not (i) modify or withdraw or refuse to make to shareholders its recommendation of the transactions or qualify it in a manner adverse to Journal, (ii) approve or recommend an alternative acquisition proposal for Scripps or (iii) approve or recommend, or enter into any agreement in respect of, an acquisition proposal for Scripps unless such acquisition proposal is a superior proposal that did not result from a breach of Scripps’ no-shop obligations, and unless the Scripps board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to change its recommendation or enter into such acquisition agreement would reasonably likely violate its fiduciary obligations under applicable law. If Scripps takes any of the aforesaid actions, it must provide written notice to Journal specifying the material terms and conditions of the superior proposal, identifying the person making such proposal and indicating that the Scripps board intends to make a change in its recommendation. Additionally, Scripps must give Journal the opportunity to match the superior proposal within five business days of notifying it of such proposal. 

A “Scripps acquisition proposal” means, other than the transactions, any offer or proposal relating to, or any third party indication of interest in, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, any direct or indirect (i) acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 15% or more of the consolidated assets of Scripps and its subsidiaries (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of Scripps or any committee thereof), or assets comprising 15% or more of the consolidated revenues of Scripps and its subsidiaries, including in any such case through the acquisition of one or more subsidiaries of Scripps owning such assets, (ii) acquisition or purchase, direct or indirect, of 15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Scripps or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of Scripps and its subsidiaries, (iii) tender offer (including a self-tender offer) or exchange offer that, if consummated, could result in any person or group beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity or voting securities of Scripps or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of Scripps and its subsidiaries, (iv) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving Scripps, or any of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute more than 15% of the consolidated assets of Scripps and its subsidiaries or (v) other transaction the completion of which could reasonably be expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay the transactions.

133

* * *

A “Scripps superior proposal” means any bona fide, unsolicited written Scripps acquisition proposal made by a third party that the Scripps board in good faith determines, after having received the advice of a nationally recognized financial advisor and outside legal counsel, taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other terms of the proposal and the person making the proposal, including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement provisions and conditions to and expected timing and risks of consummation, the form of consideration offered and the ability of the person making such Scripps acquisition proposal to obtain financing, and any changes to the terms of the master agreement proposed by Journal in response to such offer or proposal or otherwise, to be more favorable, including without limitation from a financial point of view, to Scripps and the Scripps shareholders than the transactions, is reasonably likely to be consummated, and for which financing, to the extent required, is then fully committed or is reasonably determined by the Scripps board to be attainable. For purposes of the definition of “Scripps superior proposal,” (A) each reference to “15% or more” or “more than 15%” in the definition of “Scripps acquisition proposal” is replaced with “100%,” (B) clauses (ii) and (iii) of the definition of “Scripps acquisition proposal” shall be read without the references to “any class of equity or” and (C) “100% of the voting securities of” is added immediately preceding the first reference to “Journal” in clause (iv) of the definition of “Scripps acquisition proposal.” The effect of these alterations of percentages for purposes of the definition of Scripps superior proposal is to require a superior proposal to constitute an offer for all, and not less than all, of Scripps’ businesses. 

Change of Recommendation by Scripps’ Board of Directors

Scripps’ Board of Directors may change its recommendation in connection with a superior proposal, prior to the approval of the transactions by Scripps shareholders, if:

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps receives a Scripps superior proposal that did not result from a violation of its no-shop obligations;  

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps’ Board of Directors concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would reasonably likely violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law;  

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps provides five business days prior notice to Journal that it intends to take such action and the reasons for such action;  

|   
---|---  
•| to the extent requested by Journal during the applicable notice period, Scripps negotiates in good faith with Journal with respect to any counter offer Journal makes to match or surpass such acquisition proposal; and  

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps’ Board of Directors continues to believe, following any such negotiations with Journal, in its good faith judgment, after having received the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and consulting with such outside counsel, that such acquisition proposal constitutes a superior proposal.  

Journal may terminate the master agreement following a change of recommendation by Scripps’ Board of Directors, and in such event, Scripps will be required to pay Journal a termination fee of approximately $15.8 million, plus expenses up to $7.5 million.

|   
---|---

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps pays Journal a termination fee of approximately $15.8 million upon termination, plus expenses up to $7.5 million.  

Conditions to the Transactions

The master agreement contains customary closing conditions, including the following conditions that apply to the obligations of both Scripps and Journal to consummate the transactions:

|   
---|---  
•| expiration or termination of the HSR waiting period;  

|   
---|---  
•| receipt of the FCC consent;  

|   
---|---  
•| absence of any order in effect issued by a U.S. federal or state court of competent jurisdiction preventing the completion of the transactions;  

|   
---|---  
•| declaration by the SEC that the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part is effective (with no stop order suspending effectiveness issued and no proceeding for such purpose pending before or threatened by the SEC);  

|   
---|---  
•| declaration by the SEC that the registration statement pertaining to shares of Journal Media Group for issuance in connection with the newspaper mergers is effective (with no stop order suspending effectiveness issued and no proceeding for such purpose pending before or threatened by the SEC);  

|   
---|---  
•| approval of the shares of Journal Media Group for listing on a nationally recognized stock exchange in the United States;   

|   
---|---  
•| the holders of Scripps common voting shares shall have approved the Scripps amendment proposal and the Scripps share issuance proposal;   

|   
---|---  
•| the Journal shareholders shall have approved the Journal spin-off proposal and the Journal merger proposal;   

|   
---|---  
•| the Scripps credit facility shall have been amended;   

|   
---|---  
•| Journal shall have received required consents of television networks ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox;   

|   
---|---  
•| receipt by each of Scripps and Journal from its respective legal counsel of a written opinion with respect to certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the transactions;   

|   
---|---  
•| the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party (with certain exceptions for inaccuracies that are de minimis or would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the party making such representations and warranties);  

|   
---|---  
•| the performance in all material respects by each party of all obligations required to be performed by it under the master agreement; and  

|   
---|---

Scripps and Journal cannot be certain when, or if, the conditions to the master agreement will be satisfied or waived, or whether the transactions will be completed. If permitted under applicable law, either Scripps or Journal may waive a condition for its own benefit and consummate the transactions even though one or more of these conditions has not been satisfied. Any determination whether to waive any condition will be made by Scripps or Journal at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time. If a condition to the master agreement is waived, Scripps and 

135

* * *

Journal, as applicable, currently intend to evaluate the materiality of any such waiver and its effect on Scripps shareholders or Journal shareholders, as applicable, in light of the facts and circumstances at the time to determine whether any resolicitation of proxies is required in light of such waiver. Neither Journal nor Scripps currently intends to waive any material condition to the completion of the transactions. If either Journal or Scripps waives any material condition and such waiver renders the disclosure in this joint proxy statement/prospectus materially misleading, Journal and Scripps will revise and recirculate this joint proxy statement/prospectus and resolicit the votes of Journal and Scripps shareholders.

Termination 

The master agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the completion of the transactions:

|   
---|---  
•| by mutual written agreement of Scripps and Journal;  

|   
---|---  
•| by either Scripps or Journal:  

|   
---|---  
•| if any U.S. federal or state court shall have issued a final and nonappealable order permanently prohibiting or making the transactions unlawful;  

|   
---|---  
•| if the closing of the transactions has not occurred on or before September 30, 2015, which we refer to as the “end date” (however, if the only conditions not satisfied are the expiration or termination of the HSR waiting period and the receipt of the FCC consent, then the end date will be extended to December 31, 2015, at the request of either Journal or Scripps), unless the failure to close by such date is due to the breach of the master agreement by the party seeking to terminate it;   

|   
---|---  
•| the Journal shareholders or the Scripps shareholders shall not have approved the proposals necessary to the consummation of the transactions to be voted on at their special meeting; or   

|   
---|---  
•| by Scripps:  

|   
---|---  
•| if the closing conditions cannot be satisfied by the end date (or the extended end date, if applicable), so long as a breach of the agreement by Scripps is not the reason such conditions cannot be satisfied.   

|   
---|---  
•| if the Journal Board of Directors fails to make, or if it changes, the Journal board recommendation, or if Journal enters into an acquisition agreement or fails to comply with its no-shop obligations or its obligation to inform Scripps of, and allow Scripps to compete with, any acquisition proposal;   

|   
---|---  
•| by Journal:  

|   
---|---  
•| if the closing conditions cannot be satisfied by the end date (or the extended end date, if applicable), so long as a breach of the agreement by Journal is not the reason such conditions cannot be satisfied.   

|   
---|---  
•| if the Scripps Board of Directors fails to make, or if it changes, the Scripps board recommendation, or if Scripps enters into an acquisition agreement or fails to comply with its no-shop obligations or its obligation to inform Journal of, and allow Journal to compete with, any acquisition proposal;   

Termination Fee

Scripps must pay to Journal a termination fee of approximately $15.8 million, plus expenses up to $7.5 million if:

|   
---|---  
•| Journal terminates the master agreement due to a breach by Scripps of its obligations with respect to its special meeting or its no-shop obligations;   

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps or Journal terminates the master agreement because Scripps shareholders do not approve the transactions and (i) prior to the special meeting of Scripps shareholders an acquisition proposal with respect to Scripps shall have been publicly made and not withdrawn and (ii) on or prior to the first anniversary of such termination Scripps enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, recommends to its shareholders, or consummates a transaction contemplated by, such acquisition proposal;   

136

* * *

|   
---|---  
•| Journal terminates the master agreement because Scripps fails to make, or because it changes, the Scripps board recommendation or enters into an agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal; or  

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps terminates the master agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal.  

Journal must pay Scripps a termination fee of approximately $15.8 million, plus expenses up to $7.5 million if: 

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps terminates the master agreement due to a breach by Journal of its obligations with respect to its special meeting or its no-shop obligations;  

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps or Journal terminates the master agreement because Journal shareholders do not approve the transactions and (i) prior to the special meeting of Journal shareholders an acquisition proposal with respect to Journal shall have been publicly made and not withdrawn and (ii) on or prior to the first anniversary of such termination Journal enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, recommends to its shareholders, or consummates a transaction contemplated by, such acquisition proposal;   

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps terminates the master agreement because Journal fails to make, or because it changes, the Journal board recommendation or enters into an agreement with respect to an acquisition proposal; or   

|   
---|---  
•| Journal terminates the master agreement to enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal.   

Under the following circumstances, Scripps or Journal, as the case may be, will pay the other a termination fee equal only to expenses up to $7.5 million: 

|   
---|---  
•| If Scripps or Journal terminates the master agreement because the other’s shareholders do not approve the transactions and no acquisition proposal with respect to the other was pending prior to the special meeting of its shareholders; or  

|   
---|---  
•| Scripps or Journal exercises its “force the vote” right and the shareholders of the other at their special meeting do not approve the transactions. The “force the vote” right of each of Scripps and Journal allows it to compel the other to hold its shareholders meeting to vote on the transactions despite the fact that the other failed to make, or because it changed, its board recommendation, or even though it has entered into an acquisition agreement for a superior proposal.   

For more information about the master agreement, see "The Master Transaction Agreement," beginning on page 125.

Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance

Scripps will indemnify all past and present directors and officers of Journal or any subsidiary thereof following the closing of the transactions to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law in connection with any actual or threatened claim, suit, or other action and any losses, claims, damages, costs, judgments, fines, penalties and other amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such claim, suit, or other action, for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to such closing, and will advance to such persons their legal costs and other expenses, subject to an undertaking by any such person to reimburse Scripps for such expenses if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to be indemnified.

Scripps and Journal agreed that all rights to indemnification from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the completion of the transactions existing prior thereto in favor of the current or former directors and officers of Journal or any of its subsidiaries will survive the transactions. 

Scripps has agreed to purchase a six-year period “tail” directors and officers liability insurance policy providing coverage and containing provisions obtainable for a premium not exceeding 300% of the aggregate annual premium currently paid by Journal and its subsidiaries for such insurance. 

Other Covenants and Agreements

Efforts to Consummate the Transactions. Scripps and Journal each agreed to use reasonable best efforts, in connection with the transactions, to:

137

* * *

|   
---|---  
•| obtain any required consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations of any governmental entity or other third party;  

|   
---|---  
•| make all required filings and submissions with any governmental entity or other third party;  

|   
---|---  
•| defend against any actions challenging the transactions;  

|   
---|---  
•| cooperate with the other party in determining which filings are required to be made prior to the closing with, and which material consents and approvals are required to be obtained prior to the closing from, governmental entities or other third parties in connection with the transactions; and  

|   
---|---  
•| cause the conditions to the transactions to be satisfied and all actions necessary to consummate the transactions to be taken.  

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of Scripps and Journal described above will not be construed to (i) require Journal Media Group, Scripps, Journal or any of their respective subsidiaries to take, or agree to take, any regulatory action, unless such action will be conditioned upon the completion of the transactions; (ii) require any payment in order to obtain any consent; or (iii) authorize or permit either party or any of its subsidiaries to take any regulatory action without the prior written consent of the other.

Amendment to Scripps Credit Agreement. Prior to the closing, Journal will use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Scripps to obtain the amendment of the Scripps credit facility to enable the termination of the Journal credit facility and retirement of the indebtedness thereunder. 

Transaction Litigation. Scripps and Journal each must promptly notify the other of any actions, suits, claims or proceedings commenced against it or its officers or directors in connection with the transactions. Scripps and Journal will cooperate in the defense of such matters, and neither will settle any such matters without the consent of the other.

Advise of Changes. Each of Scripps and Journal must promptly notify the other of certain matters, including: 

|   
---|---  
•| any material communication from any governmental authority in connection with the transactions;   

|   
---|---  
•| any failure of it to comply with any covenant or condition under the master agreement;   

|   
---|---  
•| any litigation commenced or threatened against it that is material to the transactions; and   

|   
---|---  
•| any termination, cancellation or non-renewal of any material contract to which it is a party.  

A failure by either party to advise the other of such change or event does not affect the representations and warranties or covenants contained in the master agreement and does not independently constitute a failure of any condition to closing under the master agreement.

Tax Matters. Scripps shall receive a written opinion from its legal counsel to the effect that for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) the SMI newspaper contribution and the SMI newspaper distribution will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code; (ii) the SMI newspaper distribution will qualify as a distribution described in Section 355 of the Code; (iii) with respect to the SMI newspaper distribution, the Scripps Spinco common stock will be treated as “qualified property” for purposes of Section 361(c)(2) of the Code; (iv) the Scripps newspaper contribution and the Scripps newspaper spin-off will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code; (v) the Scripps newspaper spin-off will qualify as a distribution described in Section 355 of the Code; (vi) with respect to the Scripps newspaper spin-off, the Scripps Spinco common stock will be treated as “qualified property” for purposes of Section 361(c)(2) of the Code; (vii) the exchange of Scripps Spinco common stock for Journal Media Group common stock pursuant to the Scripps newspaper merger will qualify as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code and/or a reorganization described in Sections 368(a)(1)(B) and/or 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code; and (viii) the broadcast merger will qualify as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code. 

Journal shall receive a written opinion from its legal counsel to the effect that for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) the Journal newspaper contribution and the Journal newspaper spin-off will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code; (ii) the Journal newspaper spin-off will qualify as a distribution described in Section 355 of the Code; (iii) the exchange of Journal Spinco common stock for Journal Media Group common stock pursuant 

138

* * *

to the Journal newspaper merger will qualify as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code and/or a reorganization described in Sections 368(a)(1)(B) and/or 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code; and (iv) the broadcast merger will qualify as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code. As a result of the application of Section 355(e), Journal will recognize gain but not loss on the distribution of shares of Journal Spinco common stock to the extent the fair market value of such shares exceeds Journal’s tax basis in such shares.

Withdrawal from GCIU Multi-Employer Pension Plan. Scripps is in the process of withdrawing as a participant in a GCIU multi-employer pension plan that members of the pressmen’s union at three of its newspapers participate in. Pursuant to the master transaction agreement, Scripps expects to pay a lump sum withdrawal liability. In connection with the withdrawal, Journal Media Group has agreed in the master transaction agreement to indemnify Scripps with respect to any additional withdrawal liability assessed as a result of a mass withdrawal from the pension plan, including any reallocation or redetermination of withdrawal liability occurring after Scripps’ withdrawal. 

Specific Performance. Each of Scripps and Journal is entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of the master agreement by the other and to enforce specifically its terms and provisions, in addition to any other remedy to which it is entitled at law or in equity. If either party breaches its obligation to consummate the transactions, the other party may request the breaching party to pay certain liquidated damages to it or it may seek specific performance of the master agreement and if it is not successful in obtaining a court order of specific performance, may then require the other to pay liquidated damages. Liquidated damages would equal a fee of approximately $15.8 million, plus reimbursement of expenses, with such fee and expenses in the aggregate subject to an overall limit of approximately $23.5 million. 

Expenses. Other than as described above in "Termination Fee,” whether or not the transactions are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the master agreement and the completion of the transactions will be borne by the party incurring such expenses, except that Scripps and Journal are responsible for 50% of the filing fees related to filings with the FCC and under the HSR Act.

Amendment. Subject to applicable law, the master agreement may be amended at any time by written agreement of Scripps and Journal, whether before or after approval by the shareholders of Scripps or Journal. Scripps and Journal may not amend the master agreement to change the newspaper exchange ratio or the broadcast exchange ratio or any other provisions the amendment of which would require approval by Scripps or Journal shareholders. 

Extension of Time; Waiver. At any time prior to the completion of the transactions either Scripps or Journal may waive any provision of the master agreement if the waiver is in writing and is signed by each party against whom the waiver is to be effective. A failure or delay to exercise a privilege shall not operate as a waiver, and no single or partial exercise of a waiver will operate as a further waiver of the same or any other privilege.

In addition, each of Mr. Wexler and Ms. Turner will receive a 2015 long-term incentive grant having a grant date value of $75,000 and $100,000, respectively. Upon commencement of employment with Scripps, each of Mr. Wexler and Ms. Turner will also receive a grant 

107

of restricted share units having an approximate grant date value of $50,000, which restricted share units will vest in equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the grant date, provided that the executive remains employed with Scripps on the applicable vesting dates. Mr. Wexler’s and Ms. Turner’s existing change-in-control agreements with Journal will continue for their stated terms. For further information regarding Mr. Wexler’s and Ms. Turner’s change-in-control agreements with Journal, see “Change-in-Control Agreements with Messrs. Fernandez, Graham and Wexler and Ms. Brenner, Taibl and Turner” beginning on page 110 and, with respect to Ms. Turner, “Transaction-Related Compensation - Journal” beginning on page 112. 

Treatment of Journal Stock Appreciation Rights ("SARs"), Journal Restricted Stock and Journal Performance Units. Journal’s executive officers have previously been granted SARs, restricted stock and performance units under Journal’s 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended, and the 2007 Omnibus Incentive Plan, which we refer to collectively as the “Journal Equity Plans.” Under the terms of the Journal Equity Plans, such outstanding equity awards generally vest in full upon consummation of a change in control transaction, if such awards are not assumed by the acquiring company. The following discussion describes more specifically the treatment of these awards in connection with the transactions, the consummation of which will constitute a change in control for purposes of the Journal Equity Plans:

|   
---|---  
•| each outstanding award of Journal SARs will be cancelled and the holders thereof will receive a cash payment equal to the fair value thereof calculated as of July 21, 2014;   

|   
---|---  
•| each outstanding share of Journal restricted stock will become fully vested and will participate in the transactions on the same basis as other Journal shareholders; and  

|   
---|---  
•| each outstanding Journal performance unit will vest (i) based on the actual level of achievement of all relevant performance goals, as determined by the Journal Compensation Committee, measured as of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the closing date of the transactions, in the case of Journal performance units granted with respect to the three-year performance period consisting of Journal’s 2013, 2014 and 2015 fiscal years, and such earned Journal performance units will be prorated based on the length of time within the performance period that has elapsed prior to the closing date of the transactions, or (ii) based on a deemed achievement of all relevant performance goals at the target level, in the case of Journal performance units granted with respect to the three-year performance period consisting of Journal’s 2014, 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, and such earned Journal performance units will be prorated based on the length of time within the performance period that has elapsed prior to the closing date of the transactions. The holders of such vested Journal performance units will receive a combination of shares of Scripps class A common stock and shares of Journal Media Group common stock, based on the number of such shares that the holder would be entitled to receive had the vested Journal performance units represented actual shares of Journal common stock as of the record date for the share exchange in connection with the transactions.   

The following table sets forth, for each of Journal’s executive officers, the number of all outstanding and unexercised Journal SARs, shares of Journal restricted stock, and Journal performance units held by each such person as of March 30, 2015, the assumed closing date of the transactions, and the estimated consideration that each will receive after the closing date of the transactions in connection with such awards. Journal’s non-employee, independent directors do not hold any Journal SARs, shares of Journal restricted stock, Journal options or Journal performance units, or any other type of unvested equity award.

(1)| All SARs were fully vested as of March 30, 2015. The cash payment for the cancelled Journal SARs reflects the estimated fair value thereof based upon a Black-Scholes model, using the following assumptions and inputs: (i) valuation date, July 21, 2014; (ii) stock price, $8.71 (Journal’s closing stock price on July 21, 2014); (iii) expected life assumption, 2 years or 3 years (based on the number of full years until the original expiration date of the SAR); (iv) volatility, 48%; (v) risk-free interest rate, 0.59% or 1.00% (based on 2 and 3-year U.S. Treasury Strip available on July 21, 2014); and (vi) dividend yield, 0%.

(2)| Determined by multiplying the number of unvested shares of Journal restricted stock and Journal performance units that will vest in connection with the transactions by $10.81, the average per-share closing price of Journal’s common stock over the first five business days following July 30, 2014, the date of Journal’s first public announcement of the transactions. For further information regarding the vesting of shares of Journal restricted stock and Journal performance units, see above under “Treatment of Journal Stock Appreciation Rights, Journal Restricted Stock and Journal Performance Units.”  
(3)| Mr. O’Brien terminated employment with Journal on May 2, 2014.

Employment Agreement with Mr. Smith 

Pursuant to Journal’s employment agreement with Mr. Smith, if his employment is terminated without cause or if he resigns for good reason, then, in addition to accrued salary, he will be entitled to receive:

|   
---|---  
•| a pro rata target annual bonus for the year of termination;  
|   
---|---  
•| a severance payment equal to three times his then-current annual salary and target annual bonus; and   
|   
---|---  
•| continued group health coverage for a period of 36 months.   

Mr. Smith’s employment agreement provides that if any payments or benefits would be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the tax code, then the payments will be limited to the maximum amount that could be paid 

109

* * *

without triggering the excise tax. 

No special severance benefits will be payable in the event Mr. Smith’s employment terminates by reason of death or disability, or if Mr. Smith is terminated for cause or resigns without good reason, or if Mr. Smith’s employment is terminated at the end of the employment period, except that in the event of Mr. Smith’s death or disability, he (or his estate) will receive a pro-rata portion of his target annual bonus earned through the date of termination. 

Mr. Smith’s employment agreement contains confidentiality, noncompetition and employee nonsolicitation covenants that apply during his employment and for 24 months after his termination of employment. 

Change-in-Control Agreements with Messrs. Fernandez, Graham and Wexler and Ms. Brenner, Taibl and Turner

Pursuant to Journal’s change-in-control agreement with each of Messrs. Fernandez, Graham and Wexler and Ms. Brenner, Ms. Taibl and Ms. Turner, if the executive’s employment is terminated without cause or if the executive resigns for good reason within two years after a change in control, in the case of Mr. Fernandez, Ms. Brenner and Ms. Taibl, or one year after a change in control, in the case of Messrs. Graham and Wexler and Ms. Turner, then, in addition to accrued salary, he or she will be entitled to receive:

|   
---|---  
•| a pro rata target annual bonus for the year of termination;  

|   
---|---  
•| a severance payment equal to a multiple of the executive’s then-current annual salary and target annual bonus (2x, in the case of Mr. Fernandez and Ms. Brenner, 1.5x, in the case of Ms. Taibl, and 1x, in the case of Messrs. Graham and Wexler and Ms. Turner); and  

|   
---|---  
•| continued group health coverage for a period of time after his or her termination (24 months, in the case of Mr. Fernandez and Ms. Brenner, 18 months, in the case of Ms. Taibl, or 12 months, in the case of Messrs. Graham and Wexler and Ms. Turner), except that the obligation to provide health coverage will end if the executive becomes employed by another employer that provides him or her with group health benefits.   

The change-in-control agreements provide that if any payments or benefits would be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the tax code, then the payments will be limited to the maximum amount that could be paid without triggering the excise tax. 

No special severance will be payable if the executive is terminated for cause or resigns without good reason, or if the executive’s employment is terminated at the end of the employment period, or if the executive’s employment terminates due to death or disability, except in the case of death or disability, the executive (or his or her estate) would be entitled to receive a pro-rata portion of the executive’s target annual bonus earned through the date of termination. 

Each of the agreements contains confidentiality and employee nonsolicitation covenants that apply during the executive’s employment and for 24 months, in the case of Mr. Fernandez and Ms. Brenner, 18 months, in the case of Ms. Taibl, or 12 months, in the case of Messrs. Graham and Wexler and Ms. Turner, after his or her termination of employment. With the exception of Ms. Taibl’s agreement, each of the change-in-control agreements also contains a noncompetition covenant that applies for 24 months, in the case of Mr. Fernandez and Ms. Brenner, or 12 months, in the case of Messrs. Graham and Wexler and Ms. Turner, after the executive terminates employment, unless he or she timely waives the severance benefits provided by the change-in-control agreement, in which case the noncompetition covenant will not apply. 

Severance Guidelines for Messrs. Miles, Kaiser, Ozolins or Prather and Ms. Trickle

Pursuant to Journal’s severance guidelines, if the executive’s employment is terminated without cause, then he or she would be entitled to receive a lump sum severance payment equal to (i) one year of his or her then-current annual salaries, in the case of Messrs. Miles, Kaiser and Ozolins and Ms. Trickle, or (ii) for each year of service with Journal, two weeks of his then-current weekly salary (subject to a minimum of six months and a maximum of 40 weeks), in the case of Mr. Prather. Each of the executives would also be entitled to continued group health coverage for a period of time after his or her termination (12 months, in the case of Messrs. Miles, Kaiser and Ozolins and Ms. Trickle, and 6 months, in the case of Mr. Prather) and out placement services.

Discretionary Retention Bonuses

Each of Messrs. Ozolins and Miles and Ms. Trickle will receive a retention bonus of $25,000, $35,000 and $35,000, respectively, provided that he or she remains employed with Journal through the consummation of the transactions, or, with respect to Ms. Trickle, through the date that is three months following the consummation of the transactions. 

Pension Benefits 

Employees’ Pension Plan. Journal’s Employees’ Pension Plan, which we refer to as the “Journal Pension Plan,” is a defined benefit pension plan that provides benefits for Journal employees, as well as employees of certain of Journal’s subsidiaries who meet minimum age and service eligibility requirements. Effective as of January 1, 2011, benefit accruals under the Journal Pension Plan were permanently frozen. Subject to certain limitations, the monthly retirement benefit under the Journal Pension Plan, assuming attainment of the retirement age specified by the plan and payments in the form of a life annuity, is determined in accordance with a formula that takes into account the following factors: final average compensation for the last five years of employment prior to the freezing of the Pension Plan, number of years of benefit service, and an actuarially determined Social Security offset. 

Messrs. Fernandez and Graham and Ms. Turner did not participate in the Journal Pension Plan because they were hired after May 1, 2006. The retirement benefit for Messrs. Kaiser, Miles, Ozolins, Prather and Wexler, Ms. Brenner, Ms. Taibl and Ms. Trickle under the Journal Pension Plan is a monthly pension equal to 1/12th of the amount determined as follows, subject to the freezing of accruals as of January 1, 2011: 

|   
---|---  
•| 0.65% of final average compensation times years of service (up to 35 years); plus  
|   
---|---  
•| 0.40% of final average compensation times years of service from 35 to 40 years; plus  
|   
---|---  
•| 0.65% of final average compensation in excess of “Covered Compensation” times years of service (up to 35 years).  

Mr. Smith was a participant in the Journal Pension Plan prior to December 31, 1998, when a different formula was in effect. His Journal Pension Plan benefit consists of the benefit account accrued as of December 31, 1998 under the prior plan formula plus the benefits determined under the above formula for service between December 31, 1998 and December 31, 2010. 

Journal’s employees hired on or before May 1, 2006 automatically became participants in the Journal Pension Plan on their entry date, which was the January 1, or July 1 after reaching age 21 and completing one year of eligible service with 1,000 hours. Journal Pension Plan benefits will begin when a participant reaches normal retirement age for Social Security purposes. Benefits can begin as early as age 60, but the benefit will be lower than at normal retirement age. 

The consummation of the transactions does not enhance the benefits payable under the Journal Pension Plan.

Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. Journal’s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, which we refer to as the “Journal SERP,” is an unfunded, nonqualified defined benefit retirement plan. Under the Journal SERP, certain executives are eligible to receive a retirement benefit based on the benefit they would receive under the Journal Pension Plan or Journal’s 401(k) plan. Benefits payable under the Journal SERP are calculated without regard to the limitations imposed by the tax code on the amount of compensation that may be taken into account under the Journal Pension Plan or Journal 401(k) plan. Effective January 1, 2011, benefit accruals under the Journal SERP were permanently frozen. 

Executives who participated in the Journal SERP will receive a supplemental benefit equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the monthly benefit payable to the executive under the Journal Pension Plan, computed without regard to the tax code limitations, but taking into account for purposes of compensation under the Journal Pension Plan only base pay plus annual incentive compensation (including any deferred amounts of base pay and annual incentive compensation), over (ii) the amount of monthly benefit actually payable to the executive under the Journal Pension Plan as limited by the tax code. 

Effective January 1, 2011, annual employer contributions are no longer a component of the Journal 401(k) plan. This prior annual employer contribution is part of the executive’s 401(k) plan balance. At the time the annual employer contribution to the 401(k) plan was made on behalf of the executive for such year, an amount was credited to the executive’s SERP account equal to the difference between: (i) the annual employer contribution that would be made to the 401(k) plan computed without regard to tax code limitations, but taking into account for purposes of compensation under the 401(k) plan only base pay (including any deferred amounts of base pay); and (ii) the amount of the annual employer contribution actually made on behalf of the executive under the 401(k) plan as limited by the tax code. Earnings will be credited to the account of each executive, from time to time, at the rate determined by the Journal Compensation Committee. 

111

* * *

Benefits which become payable to an executive under the Journal SERP will be payable upon the later of the executive’s attainment of age 60 or his or her termination of employment. 

Messrs. Kaiser, Prather, Smith and Wexler and Ms. Brenner and Ms. Taibl participate in the Journal SERP. Messrs. Fernandez, Graham, Miles and Ozolins and Ms. Turner and Ms. Trickle do not participate in the Journal SERP. The consummation of the transactions does not enhance the benefits payable under the Journal SERP. 

Deferred Compensation 

Journal’s Deferred Compensation Plan allows participants to defer a portion or all of their base salary and a portion or all of their payment from the annual bonus plan. There is no limitation on the amount participants may choose to defer. The participant’s deferrals receive an annual return based on the prime interest rate minus 1.5%. Upon a participant’s termination of employment, he or she may elect to receive his or her distribution in a lump sum or annual installments over a period of ten years. If a participant’s death occurs prior to the payment of any amounts to him under the Journal Deferred Compensation Plan, other than payments for unforeseeable emergencies, the participant will receive his or her distribution in five annual installments. If a participant’s death occurs after the payment of any amount to him under the Journal Deferred Compensation Plan, other than payments for unforeseeable emergencies, his beneficiary will receive the distributions in the same form as paid to the participant prior to his death. In the event of an unforeseeable emergency (as defined) either before or after the commencement of payments under the Journal Deferred Compensation Plan, a participant may request that all or any portion of his or her benefits be paid in one or more installments prior to the normal time for payment of such amounts. 

Messrs. Fernandez and Prather are the only executive officers that participate in the Journal Deferred Compensation Plan and they will receive payments thereunder in accordance with their deferral elections. The consummation of the transactions does not enhance the benefits payable under the Journal Deferred Compensation Plan. 

Transaction-Related Compensation - Journal 

The following table sets forth the information required by Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act regarding the compensation that is or may become payable to Journal’s named executive officers that is based on or otherwise relates to the transactions. This compensation is referred to as “golden parachute” compensation by applicable SEC disclosure rules, and such compensation is subject to a non-binding, advisory vote of Journal’s shareholders, as described above in the section “Journal Proposals to be Voted on at the Special Meeting - Journal Compensation Proposal.” 

For purposes of this table, we have assumed that:

|   
---|---  
•| the consummation of the transactions occurs on March 30, 2015;  
|   
---|---  
•| the named executive officer’s employment is terminated without cause or he or she resigns for good reason on March 30, 2015; and  
|   
---|---  
•| no reduction would be made to the payments to the named executive officers in order to avoid triggering the excise tax under tax code Sections 280G and 4999.

Risks Related to Journal Media Group after the Transactions 

Journal Media Group has no history operating as a stand-alone, publicly traded company on which you can evaluate its performance. 

Journal Media Group has no operating history as a combined business or as a stand-alone, publicly traded company. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Journal Media Group’s business strategy and operations will be successful on a combined stand-alone basis. Journal Media Group may not be able to grow or integrate its business as planned and may not be profitable.

40

* * *

No historical financial statements showing Journal Media Group’s operation of the newspaper publishing businesses of Scripps and Journal as a combined, stand-alone company exist upon which you can evaluate its prospects. 

Since Journal Media Group has not operated the newspaper publishing businesses of Scripps and Journal on a combined, stand-alone basis, it does not have any historical financial statements as an independent, stand-alone company upon which you can evaluate it. 

The historical and pro forma financial information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus may not be indicative of Journal Media Group’s future results as a stand-alone, publicly traded company. 

The historical carve-out financial statements of the Scripps newspaper business and Journal newspaper business and the pro forma financial statements giving effect to the newspaper mergers have been created from Scripps’ and Journal’s financial information. Accordingly, the historical carve-out and pro forma financial information for the newspaper businesses included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus may not reflect what Journal Media Group’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been had it been operated as a combined business and a stand-alone, publicly traded company during the periods presented. Nor may such information be indicative of what its results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be in the future. This is primarily a result of the following factors:

|   
---|---  
•| the historical carve-out financial statements do not reflect certain changes that will occur in Journal Media Group’s funding and operations as a result of the separation of Scripps Spinco and Journal Spinco from Scripps and Journal, respectively;  

|   
---|---  
•| Journal Media Group’s historical financial information reflects estimated allocations for services historically provided by our parent companies to Scripps Spinco and Journal Spinco, and we expect these allocations to be different from the costs it will incur for these services in the future; and  

|   
---|---  
•| the historical financial information and pro forma adjustments do not reflect the potential for increased or duplicative costs Journal Media Group may incur in becoming a stand-alone, publicly traded company, such as costs attributable to transition service agreements it will have with Scripps, or changes in historical cost structure due to Journal Media Group’s differing personnel needs, financing activities and operations.  

For these or other reasons, Journal Media Group’s future financial performance may be worse than the performance implied by the historical carve-out information of Scripps newspapers and Journal newspapers and pro forma financial information of Journal Media Group presented in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

For additional information about the past financial performance of each of the combined businesses, please see “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Financial Information,” “Selected Historical Financial Data of Scripps and Journal,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and the historical carve-out financial statements and the accompanying notes of Scripps newspapers and Journal newspapers included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The integration of the newspaper businesses of Journal and Scripps will be time consuming, may distract Journal Media Group’s management from its operations, and will be expensive, all of which could have a material adverse effect on Journal Media Group’s operating results. 

If Journal Media Group is unsuccessful in integrating the newspaper operations of Scripps and Journal, or if the integration is more difficult or costly than anticipated, Journal Media Group may experience disruptions to its operations. A difficult or unsuccessful integration of these businesses would likely have a material adverse effect on Journal Media Group’s results of operations.

Some of the risks that may affect Journal Media Group’s ability to integrate or realize any anticipated benefits include those associated with:

|   
---|---  
•| adverse effects on employees and business relationships with customers and suppliers;  

|   
---|---  
•| difficulties in conforming standards, processes, procedures and controls of the businesses;  

|   
---|---  
•| difficulties in transferring processes and know-how;  

41

* * *

|   
---|---  
•| difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations, technologies or products; and  

|   
---|---  
•| diversion of management’s attention from business concerns.  

Journal Media Group will need to either contract for or internally develop a number of key services and functions that its parent companies have historically provided. 

Journal Media Group has not previously performed the various corporate functions required of a publicly traded company. Scripps and Journal, the parent companies, have historically performed many important corporate functions for each of the businesses and will continue to do so before the newspaper mergers, including finance, treasury, tax administration, risk management, accounting, internal audit, financial reporting, legal, regulatory, human resources, employee benefit administration, communications, information technology, digital and business development services. After the transactions close, Scripps will provide a number of services to Journal Media Group for a limited time under the transition services agreement. When these transition services cease to be provided, Journal Media Group will need to replace these services internally or through third parties. The services obtained from Scripps will be provided at fair market value, which nonetheless may be higher than the costs borne in the past. Replacement services may be available only on terms that are less favorable to Journal Media Group, or may not be available to it at all.

Journal Media Group will also need to replicate certain facilities, systems and infrastructure to which it will no longer have access as well as hire new employees to provide these services. There can be no assurance that Journal Media Group will be able to obtain these services or hire the necessary employees at similar cost-levels or at all. In addition, Journal Media Group management will have to spend considerable time in building an independent infrastructure for corporate, administrative and information technology functions. These initiatives will be costly to implement and the scope and complexity of these projects may be materially higher than expected.

If Journal Media Group does not have adequate systems and business functions of its own or cannot obtain them from third party providers at an acceptable cost, Journal Media Group may not be able to operate its business effectively, which could have a material adverse effect on profitability.

Journal Media Group may not realize the benefits expected by combining the newspaper businesses of Scripps and Journal into a new publicly traded company and may experience increased costs after the newspaper mergers that could decrease overall profitability. 

Before the newspaper mergers, Journal Media Group’s business was part of two separate public companies. Journal Media Group may experience difficulties in integrating the two businesses into one company, and the newspaper mergers may result in increased costs and inefficiencies in its business operations and management. Integration of Journal Media Group’s businesses may cost significantly more or take longer than anticipated, which could decrease profitability or otherwise impact expected cost-savings. In addition, prior to the newspaper mergers Journal Media Group’s businesses took advantage of the economies of scale of Scripps and Journal. As a separate, stand­alone, publicly traded company, Journal Media Group may be unable to obtain goods, services and technology at prices or on terms as favorable as those obtained prior to the newspaper mergers, which could decrease overall profitability. Furthermore, Journal Media Group may not be successful in transitioning from the services and systems provided by Scripps and Journal and may incur substantially higher costs for implementation than currently anticipated. At such point in time as Journal Media Group begins to operate these functions independently, if Journal Media Group does not have in place its own adequate systems and business functions, or outsource them from other providers, it may not be able to operate its business effectively or at comparable costs, and it may have a material adverse effect on Journal Media Group’s profitability. If Journal Media Group fails to realize the anticipated benefits of the newspaper mergers, including, without limitation, the anticipated cost-savings resulting from operating synergies and growth opportunities from combining the businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on profitability.

Restrictions on Journal Media Group’s operations and obligations to indemnify Scripps and its shareholders in connection with the tax-free treatment of the spin-offs and newspaper mergers could materially and adversely affect Journal Media Group. 

Certain tax-related restrictions and indemnities set forth in the tax matters agreements agreed to by Scripps, Journal and Journal Media Group in order to maintain the tax-free treatment of the spin-offs and newspaper mergers limit Journal Media Group’s discretion in the operation of its business and could adversely affect Journal Media Group. Under these provisions, Journal Media Group: 

42

* * *

|   
---|---  
•| has generally undertaken to maintain the current newspaper business of Scripps and Journal as an active business for a period of two years following the completion of the newspaper mergers;  

|   
---|---  
•| is generally restricted, for a period of two years following the newspaper mergers, from (i) reacquiring its stock, (ii) issuing stock to any person other than as compensation for services, (iii) making changes in equity structure, (iv) liquidating, merging or consolidating certain of subsidiaries, (v) transferring certain material assets except in the ordinary course of business, and (vi) entering into negotiations with respect to, or consenting to, certain acquisitions of stock;  

|   
---|---  
•| is generally restricted from taking any other action (including an action that would be inconsistent with the representations relied upon by Scripps and Journal described above) that could jeopardize the tax-free status of the spin-offs; and  

|   
---|---  
•| has generally agreed to indemnify Scripps and Journal for taxes and related losses incurred as a result of the spin-offs (other than the spin-off of Journal Spinco, which will be taxable to Journal) failing to qualify as tax-free transactions provided such taxes and related losses are attributable to any act, failure to act or omission by Journal Media Group or its subsidiaries, including our failure to comply with applicable representations, undertakings and restrictions placed on our actions under the tax matters agreement.  

These prohibitions could discourage, delay or prevent equity financings, acquisitions, investments, strategic alliances, mergers and other transactions, possibly resulting in a material adverse effect on Journal Media Group’s business. In addition, any indemnity obligations to Scripps or Journal could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and liquidity.

Any financing arrangements that Journal Media Group may enter into may subject it to various restrictions that could limit operating flexibility. 

Journal Media Group currently expects to enter into a credit facility prior to the completion of the transactions and it expects that the credit facility will contain certain covenants and other restrictions that, among other things, will require it to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios and restrict its ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness and create liens. The restrictions and covenants in any such financing arrangements may limit Journal Media Group’s ability to respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings Journal Media Group may incur. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources of Journal Media Group.”

Journal Media Group will no longer be able to rely on Scripps and Journal for diversification of business risk or to provide capital resources. 

Before the newspaper mergers, the newspaper businesses that will merge into Journal Media Group were operated as separate businesses of two different companies. Following the newspaper mergers, Journal Media Group’s ability to satisfy obligations and maintain profitability will be solely dependent upon its performance and it will not be able to rely upon the financial and other resources of Scripps and Journal. 

Journal Media Group may be required to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to its former parent companies or may not be able to collect on indemnification rights from its former parent companies. 

Under the terms of the master agreement, Scripps (as successor to Journal) will indemnify Journal Media Group, and Journal Media Group will indemnify Scripps (as successor to Journal), for all damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from a breach by the applicable party of the covenants contained in the master agreement that continue in effect after the closing. Scripps (as successor to Journal) will indemnify Journal Media Group for all damages, liabilities and expenses incurred by it relating to the entities, assets and liabilities retained by Scripps or Journal, and Journal Media Group will indemnify Scripps (as successor to Journal) for all damages, liabilities and expenses incurred by it relating to Journal Media Group’s entities, assets and liabilities. 

In addition, Scripps will indemnify Journal Media Group, and Journal Media Group will indemnify Scripps for all damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from a breach by them of any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in the tax matters agreements. Journal Media Group will also indemnify Scripps for all damages, liabilities and expenses arising out of any tax imposed with respect to the Scripps Spinco spin-off if such tax is attributable to any act, any failure to act or any omission by Journal Media Group or any of its subsidiaries. Scripps will indemnify Journal Media Group for all damages, liabilities and expenses relating to pre-closing taxes or taxes imposed on Journal Media Group or its 

43

* * *

subsidiaries because Scripps Spinco or Journal Spinco was part of the consolidated return of Scripps or Journal, and Journal Media Group will indemnify Scripps for all damages, liabilities and expenses relating to post-closing taxes of Journal Media Group or its subsidiaries.

The indemnification obligations described above could be significant and Journal Media Group cannot presently determine the amount, if any, of indemnification obligations for which it will be liable or for which it will seek payment from Scripps. Journal Media Group’s ability to satisfy these indemnities will depend upon future financial performance. Similarly, the ability of Scripps to satisfy any such obligations to Journal Media Group will depend on their respective future financial performance. Journal Media Group cannot assure you that it will have the ability to satisfy any substantial obligations to Scripps or that Scripps (including Scripps as successor to Journal) will have the ability to satisfy any substantial indemnity obligations to Journal Media Group.

Decreases in advertising spending, resulting from economic downturn, war, terrorism, advertiser consolidation or other factors, could adversely affect Journal Media Group’s financial condition and results of operations.

Had it operated as an independent company in 2013, approximately 60% of Journal Media Group’s revenue would have been generated from the sale of local, regional and national advertising appearing in its newspapers and shoppers. Advertisers generally reduce their advertising spending during economic downturns and some advertisers may go out of business or declare bankruptcy. The merger or consolidation of advertisers, such as in the banking and airline industries, also generally leads to a reduced amount of collective advertising spending. A recession or economic downturn, as well as a consolidation of advertisers, has had, and in the future could continue to have, an adverse effect on Journal Media Group’s financial condition and results of operations. Terrorist attacks or other wars involving the United States or any other local or national crisis could adversely affect Journal Media Group’s financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, some of Journal Media Group’s printed publications are expected to generate a large percentage of their advertising revenue from a limited number of sources, including the automotive industry. As a result, even in the absence of a recession or economic downturn, adverse changes specifically affecting these advertising sources could significantly reduce advertising revenue and have a material adverse effect on Journal Media Group’s financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, Journal Media Group expects advertising revenue and subscription revenue to depend upon a variety of other factors specific to the communities that it will serve. Changes in those factors could negatively affect those revenues. These factors include, among others, the size and demographic characteristics of the local population, the concentration of retail stores and local economic conditions in general. If the population demographics, prevailing retail environment or local economic conditions of a community to be served by Journal Media Group were to change adversely, revenue could decline and its financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Journal Media Group will operate in highly competitive markets, and during a time of rapid competitive changes, it may lose market share and advertising revenue to competing publications, or other competitors, as well as through consolidation of competitors or changes in advertisers’ buying strategies.

Journal Media Group’s businesses will operate in highly competitive markets. Journal Media Group’s newspapers, shoppers and Internet sites will compete for audiences and advertising revenue with other newspapers, television and radio stations, shoppers and Internet sites as well as with other media such as magazines, outdoor advertising, direct mail and the evolving mobile and digital advertising space. Some of Journal Media Group’s potential competitors have greater financial, marketing and programming resources than it will or, even if smaller in size or in terms of financial resources, a greater ability to create digital niche products and communities and may respond faster or more aggressively to changing competitive dynamics. This competition has intensified as a result of digital media technologies. While the amount of advertising on Journal’s and Scripps’ digital products has continued to increase, each of Journal and Scripps has experienced, and in the future Journal Media Group may continue to experience, a decrease in advertising revenues.

In newspapers and shoppers, Journal Media Group’s revenue is expected to primarily consist of advertising and subscription revenue. Competition for advertising expenditures and subscription revenue is expected to come from local, regional and national newspapers, shoppers, magazines, broadcast and cable television, radio, direct mail, Yellow Pages, digital Internet and mobile products and other media. Competition for newspaper advertising revenue is based largely upon advertiser results, advertising rates, readership, demographics and circulation levels, while competition for subscription revenue is based largely upon the content of the newspaper, its price, editorial quality and customer service. Journal Media Group’s local and regional competitors in community publications are typically unique to each market, but it has many competitors for advertising revenue that are larger and have greater financial and distribution resources than it. Subscription revenue and Journal Media Group’s ability to achieve price increases for its print products are affected by competition from other 

44

* * *

publications and other forms of media available in its various markets, declining consumer spending on discretionary items like newspapers, decreasing amounts of free time, and declining frequency of regular newspaper buying among young people. Journal Media Group may incur increasing costs competing for advertising expenditures and paid print and digital subscriptions. If Journal Media Group is not able to compete effectively for advertising expenditures and paid print and digital subscriptions, its revenue may decline and its financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

The print newspaper business is in secular decline. Journal Media Group’s profitability may be adversely affected if it is unsuccessful in creating other revenue opportunities or in aligning costs with declining revenues.

In recent years, the advertising industry generally has experienced a secular shift toward digital advertising and away from other traditional media. In addition, Scripps’ and Journal’s newspaper circulation has declined, reflecting general trends in the newspaper industry, including consumer migration toward the Internet and other media for news and information. Journal Media Group expects to face increasing competition from other digital sources for both advertising and subscription revenues. This competition has intensified as a result of the continued development of digital media technologies. Distribution of news, entertainment and other information over the Internet, as well as through smartphones, tablets and other devices, continues to increase in popularity. These technological developments are increasing the number of media choices available to advertisers and audiences. As media audiences fragment, Journal Media Group expects advertisers to continue to allocate larger portions of their advertising budgets to digital media.

In response to the ongoing secular changes, Journal Media Group must continually monitor and align its cost structure to the declining revenues. The alignment of Journal Media Group’s costs includes measures such as reduction in force initiatives, standardization and centralization of systems and processes, outsourcing of certain financial processes and the implementation of new software for its circulation, advertising and editorial systems.

If Journal Media Group is unsuccessful in creating other revenue opportunities, developing digital media or aligning its costs with declining revenues, its profitability could be adversely affected.

Journal Media Group expects a significant portion of its operating cost to come from newsprint, so an increase in price or reduction in supplies may adversely affect its operating results.

Journal Media Group expects newsprint to be a significant portion of its operating costs. The price of newsprint has historically been volatile, and increases in the price of newsprint could materially reduce Journal Media Group’s operating results. In addition, the continued reduction in the capacity of newsprint producers increases the risk that supplies of newsprint could be limited in the future. Journal Media Group’s publishing business may suffer if there is a significant increase in the cost of newsprint or a reduction in the availability of newsprint.

Changes relating to consumer information collection and use could adversely affect Journal Media Group’s ability to collect and use data, which could harm its business.

Public concern over methods of information gathering has led to the enactment of legislation in most jurisdictions that restricts the collection and use of consumer information. Journal Media Group’s publishing business is expected to rely in part on telemarketing sales, which are affected by “do not call” legislation at both the federal and state levels. Journal Media Group also expects to engage in e-mail marketing and the collection and use of consumer information in connection with its publishing businesses and its growing digital efforts. Further legislation, government regulations, industry regulations, the issuance of judicial interpretations or a change in customs relating to the collection, management, aggregation and use of consumer information could materially increase the cost of collecting that data, or limit Journal Media Group’s ability to provide information to its customers or otherwise utilize telemarketing or e-mail marketing or distribute its digital products across multiple platforms, and could adversely affect its results of operations.

Decreases in circulation may adversely affect subscription revenues, and circulation decreases may accelerate as Journal Media Group offers expanded digital content and digital subscriptions.

Advertising and subscription revenues are affected by the number of subscribers and single copy purchasers, readership levels and overall audience reach. The newspaper industry as a whole is experiencing difficulty maintaining paid print circulation and related revenues. This is due to, among other factors, increased competition from new media products and sources other than traditional newspapers (often free to users), and shifting preferences among some consumers to receive all or a portion of their news other than from a newspaper. In addition, Journal Media Group’s planned expanded digital content and new digital subscriptions could negatively impact print circulation volumes if readers cancel subscriptions.

45

* * *

A prolonged decrease in circulation could have a material effect on Journal Media Group’s revenues, particularly if it is not able to otherwise grow its readership levels and overall audience reach. To maintain Journal’s and Scripps’ circulation base, Journal Media Group may incur additional costs, and it may not be able to recover these costs through subscription and advertising revenues. 

If Journal Media Group is unable to respond to changes in technology and evolving industry standards and trends, its publishing operations may not be able to effectively compete.

The publishing industry is being challenged by the preferences of today’s “on demand” culture, particularly among younger segments of the population. Some consumers prefer to receive all or a portion of their news in new media formats and from sources other than traditional newspapers. Information delivery and programming alternatives such as the Internet, various mobile devices, electronic readers, cable, direct satellite-to-home services, pay-per-view and home video and entertainment systems have fractionalized newspaper readership. New digital subscription offerings may not attract readers in sufficient numbers to generate significant revenues or offset losses in paid print subscription revenues. The shift in consumer behaviors has the potential to introduce new market competitors or change the means by which traditional newspaper advertisers can most efficiently and effectively reach their target audiences. Journal Media Group may not have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new products or services that could compete with these evolving technologies.

Journal Media Group will face cybersecurity and similar risks, which could result in the disclosure of confidential information, disruption of its operations, damage to its brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses.

Security breaches, computer malware or other “cyber attacks” could harm Journal Medial Group's business by disrupting the delivery of services, jeopardizing its confidential information and that of its vendors and clients, and damaging its reputation. Journal Medial Group's operations are expected to routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information. Although Journal Media Group will monitor its security measures regularly and believes it is not in a key target industry, any unauthorized intrusion, malicious software infiltration, theft of data, network disruption, denial of service, or similar act by any party could disrupt the integrity, continuity, and security of Journal Medial Group's systems or the systems of its clients or vendors. These events could create financial liability, regulatory sanction, or a loss of confidence in Journal Medial Group's ability to protect information, and adversely affect its revenue by causing the loss of current or potential clients.

Titles: Background of the Transactions

<a name="sD3676CED2E61CAD4F7D550CFB131087E"></a>

Background of the Transactions

Scripps senior management regularly reviews various business strategies and potential acquisition opportunities, both as presented by investment bankers and as part of a regular review of Scripps’ assets and business operations. In addition, senior management and the board of directors review potential opportunities in light of overall asset allocation strategies and the goal of enhancing shareholder value. Some factors considered in evaluating opportunities include adding second stations in markets in Scripps’ current geographic broadcast footprint, addressing regulatory compliance issues, diversifying network affiliations, diversifying revenue streams and business operations and strengthening digital efforts.

Late in the fourth quarter of 2013, Scripps began considering strategic alternatives for its newspaper business. The alternatives considered were retention of all of the newspapers, or a sale of some or all of the newspapers. Prior to commencement of discussions with Journal, Scripps neither solicited nor received indications of interest from third parties with respect to any of its newspapers, and did not enter into any negotiations with third parties with regard to any such sale. Ultimately, Scripps determined that it was in the best interest of its shareholders to combine its newspaper business with Journal’s newspaper business. 

The Journal board of directors and senior management in the ordinary course of business regularly review and evaluate the possibility of pursuing various strategic opportunities as part of their ongoing efforts to strengthen Journal’s business and enhance shareholder value, taking into account economic, competitive, regulatory and other conditions. Journal’s goal is to grow its traditional and digital media, make capital investments in its business which are expected to positively impact revenue, and look for new acquisition opportunities within the broadcast industry to create long-term value for shareholders. As an essential component of this strategy, the Journal board of directors and senior management continuously assess existing businesses and assets and related acquisition, divestiture and business combination opportunities. As part of this process, from time to time, Journal’s senior management has had conversations and communications with various investment banking firms regarding potential opportunities. 

Over recent years, Journal engaged in discussions regarding numerous strategic opportunities which varied in degree from “preliminary” to “active pursuit of merger partners.” In June 2012, Journal made initial outbound indications to the management of a broadcasting company seeking to explore a potential strategic combination and subsequently submitted a preliminary indication of interest in such counterparty’s auction process. Journal ultimately decided not to pursue the transaction because, in Journal’s view, the price required to continue in the auction process and the likelihood that a large cash component would have to be funded through a debt financing (resulting in high leverage) diminished the value creation potential for Journal shareholders. Journal engaged in a series of meetings and discussions to increase the scale of Journal’s broadcasting business with three other broadcasting companies as well as a family-owned company during the year leading up to the discussions with Scripps. In addition to direct meetings involving Journal senior management, at Journal’s request, Journal’s financial advisor, Methuselah, held exploratory conversations on behalf of Journal with four other companies that operated broadcasting businesses to assess their level of interest in exploring a combination transaction that improved the positioning and increased the market power of Journal. These conversations did not advance beyond a conceptual stage. In the case of one such company, Journal received an indication of a conceptual structure but no formal written proposal. No other discussions resulted in formal proposals to Journal. Journal also received inquiries relating to its publishing division from two different third parties. Neither inquiry resulted in a transaction.

Beginning in mid-2012, the Journal board of directors began working with its advisors to identify, review and evaluate various strategic opportunities and objectives with the goal of enhancing shareholder value, including a merger or other business combination, and strategic acquisitions and divestitures, as well as continued execution of its long-term business plan, or any combination thereof. In connection with these efforts, Journal had conversations with representatives of other companies regarding potential business combination opportunities, although none of these conversations, other than the discussions of the transactions with Scripps, resulted in an agreement.

On November 8, 2013, given Journal’s historical relationship with Methuselah and Methuselah’s familiarity with Journal and the newspaper and broadcast industries, Journal engaged Methuselah as financial advisor to assist Journal in its evaluation of potential strategic transactions. At approximately the same time, Journal contacted its long-time outside counsel, Foley & Lardner LLP, which we refer to as “Foley,” to serve as legal counsel in connection with any such potential strategic transaction.

In late December 2013, Steven J. Smith, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Journal, called Richard A. Boehne, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Scripps, and informed Mr. Boehne that he would like to meet in person in early 2014 to discuss the future of Journal Communications and a possible combination with Scripps. Mr. Smith contacted Mr. Boehne following a discussion, at the direction of Journal, between Methuselah and Mr. Boehne in which 

63

* * *

<a name="sD3676CED2E61CAD4F7D550CFB131087E"></a>

Methuselah outlined Journal’s view of a possible combination transaction that would combine both Scripps’ publishing and broadcasting businesses with Journal’s publishing and broadcasting businesses in industry-specific verticals. Mr. Boehne indicated that Scripps recently had begun an internal review of its publishing operations. Mr. Smith subsequently contacted Mr. Boehne, which resulted in a lunch meeting on February 5, 2014.

On February 5, 2014, Mr. Smith and Mr. Boehne, together with a representative of Methuselah, met to discuss a potential business combination transaction between Journal and Scripps, including the potential framework of a transaction. Journal and Scripps explored the merits of a potential merger of their respective publishing and broadcasting businesses in separate, pure-play vertically integrated companies through a separation of such businesses at both companies and the establishment of dedicated management at each resulting enterprise to facilitate the success of each such business.

On February 10, 2014, Mr. Boehne contacted representatives of Wells Fargo Securities, which we refer to as “Wells,” to act as financial advisor to Scripps in connection with a potential transaction with Journal.

On February 11, 2014, at a regularly scheduled meeting, the Journal board of directors discussed with members of Journal management and a representative of Methuselah a potential business combination transaction with Scripps and the potential merits and operational benefits of such a transaction. Mr. Smith discussed with the other directors of Journal his meeting with Mr. Boehne on February 5, 2014, and the opportunity for combining Journal and Scripps. The Journal board of directors authorized representatives of Journal to continue evaluating a potential business combination transaction with Scripps to determine the feasibility and value-enhancing potential of such a transaction.

On February 12, 2014, Scripps engaged its long-time outside counsel, Baker & Hostetler, LLP, which we refer to as “Baker,” to serve as legal counsel in connection with a potential transaction with Journal.

On February 24, 2014, at a dinner the night before a regularly scheduled Scripps’ board meeting on February 25, 2014, Mr. Boehne discussed with the other directors of Scripps his meeting with Mr. Smith on February 5, 2014, and the opportunity for combining Journal and Scripps. The Scripps directors agreed that Scripps senior management should evaluate a potential business combination transaction with Journal and continue discussions with Mr. Smith and other members of Journal senior management. 

On February 26, 2014, Mr. Boehne, along with Robin A. Davis, Vice President of Strategic Planning & Development of Scripps, had a telephone conversation with Mr. Smith to discuss a potential business combination transaction.

On February 28, 2014, Journal and Scripps entered into a confidentiality agreement in connection with the parties’ evaluation of a potential business combination transaction. Between then and April 21, 2014, due diligence information was exchanged between Journal and Scripps.

On March 3, 2014, at a special telephonic meeting, the Journal board continued discussions with a representative of Methuselah regarding a potential business combination transaction with Scripps and the potential merits and operational benefits of such a transaction.

On April 1, 2014, at a telephonic meeting, Scripps’ senior management and representatives of Wells reviewed and discussed various matters relating to a potential business combination transaction with Journal, including a preliminary discussion of financial aspects of, and potential framework for, a transaction.

On April 3, 2014, at a special telephonic meeting, the Journal board again met to discuss with members of Journal senior management and a representative of Methuselah a potential business combination transaction with Scripps and the potential merits and operational benefits of such a transaction.

On April 8, 2014, Mr. Smith and Mr. Boehne, together with representatives of Methuselah and Wells, met during the convention of the National Association of Broadcasters in Las Vegas, Nevada, to continue discussions regarding a potential business combination transaction between Journal and Scripps, including the potential framework for a transaction. The parties discussed the mutual goal of positioning both the publishing and broadcasting enterprises for success and allocating financial obligations in a manner consistent with the legacy businesses. During this meeting, Mr. Boehne indicated that Scripps senior management, with advice from Baker, had determined that the FCC would not approve a proposed transaction if the Scripps family controlled both Scripps and a new company combining the Scripps and Journal newspaper businesses. Given that conclusion, Mr. Boehne stated that if the proposed transaction discussions progressed, he would ask the Scripps family to amend the Scripps Family Agreement so that the family would not control the new newspaper company in the event a transaction was consummated.

Between July 25, 2014 and July 30, 2014, members of senior management of Scripps and Journal finalized the key aspects of the transactions for recommendations to their respective boards.

Scripps and Journal agreed on the final structure of the proposed transactions after consideration of the strategic logic for combining like businesses, the potential synergies of the combinations, the regulatory restrictions on media cross-ownership, and the merits of achieving a tax-efficient transaction. During these negotiations, the parties considered various factors in weighting the positives and negatives of the transaction and its final structure as more fully described under the sections entitled “Scripps’ Reasons for the Transactions and Recommendation of Scripps’ Board of Directors” and “Journal’s Reasons for the Transactions and Recommendation of Journal’s Board of Directors.” 

In negotiating the exchange ratios, Scripps and Journal considered, among other factors, their respective views of the relative values of each company’s newspaper and broadcast businesses and the potential synergies that could reasonably be expected from the combinations; the opportunity to pay a tax-efficient dividend to Scripps shareholders, the optimum number of outstanding shares of Journal Media Group to have outstanding for purposes of trading liquidity, and the potential trading range of the stocks of Scripps and Journal Media Group following completion of the transactions. No single definitive analysis was used to determine the exchange ratios in the negotiations. Rather, the entirety of the work performed by Scripps and Journal with the assistance of their respective advisors in analyzing financial and other information informed the positions of each party in negotiating and arriving at the final exchange ratios. 

The allocation of assets and liabilities pursuant to the master agreement was based primarily on the operational needs of the broadcast businesses and the newspaper businesses and the desire to provide Journal Media Group with the financial flexibility to succeed. Additionally, Scripps and Journal agreed that liabilities and contingencies should follow the business (newspaper or broadcast) to which they primarily related. Pension obligations were allocated to the broadcast businesses, reflecting the decision of Scripps and Journal to combine their respective newspaper businesses with minimal long-term financial obligations. The parties determined the final allocation in order to ensure that both companies could operate their businesses in the normal course while also providing strong balance sheets with capacity to make further investments and acquisitions and pursue strategic opportunities. The parties also took into consideration the relative opportunities and challenges in the broadcasting and newspaper industries. Since Scripps and Journal believed it was important to ensure that Journal Media Group had flexibility to pursue strategic objectives, they agreed to start Journal Media Group in a net cash position. In addition, Journal Media Group expects to enter into a credit facility prior to the closing of the transactions. 

During the negotiations, Scripps and Journal agreed that Scripps would pay a $60 million dividend to its shareholders prior to completion of the broadcast merger and the Journal shareholders would receive as a result of the broadcast merger ownership of approximately 31% of the equity of Scripps following completion of the transactions. The leverage and capital structure of Scripps following the transactions, the relative ownership of Scripps by the Scripps shareholders and the Journal shareholders, and the economic value of a tax-efficient dividend to the Scripps shareholders were the main factors considered by the parties in determining the dividend. 

Scripps and Journal agreed that it was appropriate to include in the master agreement certain mutual "deal protection" and related provisions for the benefit of each of them. The provisions agreed upon in the negotiations included mutual "no-shop," "fiduciary out," "matching rights" and termination fee provisions that Scripps and Journal believe are customary in transactions similar to the transactions contemplated by the master transaction agreement. 

In negotiating the post-closing management and governance structures of Journal Media Group, the parties evaluated candidates’ qualifications for particular management positions and took into consideration attributes they believed to be best suited to the newspaper business that Journal Media Group would operate following completion of the transactions. The post-closing governance structure was also negotiated by the parties, taking into consideration the current governance structures of Scripps and Journal, the pro forma ownership and size of the post-transaction companies and the parties’ views as to an appropriate structure for the respective businesses and industry. The governance structure of Journal Media Group has been designed to meet the standards required by the New York Stock Exchange, on which the parties expect Journal Media Group’s stock will be traded. 

During the afternoon of July 30, 2014, at a special telephonic meeting, the Scripps board of directors, together with members of the Scripps senior management and representatives of Wells, discussed various matters in connection with the potential transaction, including a summary of material terms in the master agreement, a summary of the proposed resolution to certain open items of negotiation, a preliminary summary of expected costs, and a set of resolutions to approve the transactions at the board level and recommend approval thereof to Scripps shareholders. Also at this meeting, representatives of Wells reviewed with the Scripps board Wells’ financial analysis of the Scripps newspaper exchange ratio and the broadcast exchange ratio provided for in the newspaper mergers and the broadcast merger. Wells rendered to the Scripps board of directors an oral

<a name="sD3676CED2E61CAD4F7D550CFB131087E"></a>

opinion, confirmed by delivery of written opinions dated July 30, 2014, to the effect that, as of that date and based on and subject to various assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and limitations on the review undertaken by Wells in connection with the opinions, the experience of its investment bankers and other factors it deemed relevant, (i) the broadcast exchange ratio pursuant to the master agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to Scripps and (ii) the Scripps newspaper exchange ratio in connection with the Scripps newspaper merger pursuant to the master agreement was fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Scripps common shares who receive shares of Scripps Spinco common stock pursuant to the Scripps newspaper spin-off. Following discussion by the directors of the terms of the master agreement and the related agreements, and taking into account the factors described under “Scripps’ Reasons for the Transactions and Recommendations of Scripps’ Board of Directors,” the Scripps board of directors unanimously determined that the master agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Scripps and its shareholders.

During the afternoon of July 30, 2014, at a special telephonic meeting, the Journal board, together with members of the Journal senior management and representatives of Foley and Methuselah, met to review and discuss various matters in connection with the potential transactions. The Journal board of directors discussed, among other matters, the proposed master agreement, tax matters agreements and employee matters agreement, certain financial aspects of the proposed transactions, the Journal and Scripps draft joint press release announcing the transactions and draft resolutions to approve and recommend the transactions to Journal shareholders. Representatives of Foley again reviewed certain matters under Wisconsin law, including the board’s fiduciary duties in connection with its evaluation of the proposed transactions. Also at this meeting, Methuselah reviewed with the Journal board of directors Methuselah’s financial analysis of the Journal newspaper exchange ratio and the broadcast exchange ratio provided for in the newspaper mergers and the broadcast merger and rendered to the Journal board of directors an oral opinion, confirmed by delivery of a written opinion dated July 30, 2014, to the effect that, as of that date and based upon and subject to the assumptions, factors and qualifications set forth in such opinion, the Journal newspaper exchange ratio and the broadcast exchange ratio provided for in the newspaper mergers and the broadcast merger, viewed as a single integrated transaction, were fair, from a financial point of view, to holders of Journal common stock collectively as a group. A representative of Journal’s management then discussed the tax and financial due diligence conducted. Representatives of Foley again summarized the key terms of the master agreement and related agreements and discussed with the Journal board the resolution of certain open points of negotiation in the agreements. Following extensive discussion by the directors of the terms of the master agreement and related agreements and taking into account the factors described under “-Journal’s Reasons for the Transactions and Recommendations of Journal’s Board of Directors,” the Journal board of directors unanimously determined that the master agreement and the transactions are advisable and fair to and in the best interests of Journal and its shareholders and approved the master agreement and the transactions and recommended that Journal shareholders approve and adopt the Journal spin-off proposal and the Journal merger proposal.

Following the Journal and Scripps board of directors meetings, Mr. Smith and Mr. Boehne informed each other of the favorable action taken by their respective board of directors.

During the evening of July 30, 2014, following the closing of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the appropriate parties entered into the master agreement, the tax matters agreements and the employee matters agreement, and Journal and Scripps issued a joint press release announcing the transactions.

Titles: Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information Utilized by Scripps and Journal

<a name="s6765454948B2077F981250CFB201B741"></a>

Certain Unaudited Prospective Financial Information Utilized by Scripps and Journal 

Journal and Scripps are including in this joint proxy statement/prospectus certain financial forecasts and financial models that Journal and Scripps prepared for their respective boards of directors in May and June 2014 in connection with the proposed transactions. The financial forecasts, but not the financial models, were provided to Journal’s and Scripps’ respective financial advisors in connection with their respective financial analyses and opinions described in “The Transactions - Opinions of Scripps’ Financial Advisor” beginning on page 72, and “The Transactions - Opinion of Journal’s Financial Advisor” beginning on page 87. Journal and Scripps do not as a matter of course publicly release projections as to prospective financial information. These financial forecasts were not prepared with a view toward public disclosure or compliance with the guidelines established by the SEC or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for preparation and presentation of prospective financial information, but, in the view of Journal’s and Scripps’ respective managements, were prepared on a reasonable basis at the time they were prepared and reflected estimates and assumptions considered reasonable by such managements. The inclusion of this information in this joint proxy statement/prospectus should not be regarded or considered as an indication by Journal, Scripps or any other recipient of this information, that such information is necessarily predictive of future results. The inclusion of the financial forecasts and models in this joint proxy statement/prospectus shall not be deemed an admission or representation by Journal or Scripps that such information is material or that such performance will be achieved. The following information should be read in conjunction with publicly available, more up-to-date information provided by Scripps and Journal, including that contained in each of their public securities filings or other publicly available information. 

The financial forecasts of Journal and Scripps, as well as the financial models of Journal Media Group and Scripps following the transactions, included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus were prepared by, and are the responsibility of, Journal’s management and Scripps’ management, respectively, and are unaudited. Neither Journal’s nor Scripps’ independent auditors, nor any other independent registered public accounting firm, have compiled, examined or performed any procedures with respect to the prospective financial information contained in the financial forecasts and models, nor have they expressed any opinion or given any form of assurance on the financial forecasts or their achievability, and they assume no responsibility for, and disclaim any association with, the prospective financial information. The reports of the independent auditors relate to the historical financial information and do not extend to the prospective financial information and should not be read to do so. 

Furthermore, the financial forecasts:

|   
---|---  
•| make numerous assumptions, as further described below, many of which reflect factors that are beyond the control of Journal and Scripps;   

|   
---|---  
•| do not necessarily reflect revised prospects for Journal’s, Scripps’ and Journal Media Group's businesses, changes in general business or economic conditions, or any other transaction or event that has occurred since, or that may occur and that was not anticipated at, the time the forecasts and models were prepared;   

|   
---|---  
•| are not necessarily indicative of current values or future performance, which may be significantly more favorable or less favorable than as set forth below; and  

|   
---|---  
•| should not be regarded as a representation that the financial forecasts and models will be achieved.  

These financial forecasts and models were prepared by the respective managements of Journal and Scripps based on information they had at the time of preparation and are not a guarantee of future performance. These financial forecasts and models are inherently subjective and uncertain in many respects and thus subject to interpretation. In connection with their respective consideration of the financial forecasts and models at the time they were prepared, each of the Journal board and the Scripps board, in accordance with its customary practice, believed that it was reasonable to rely on the financial forecasts and models prepared by each company’s management but did not make any formal determination that such financial forecasts were necessarily predictive of actual future results. Neither Journal nor Scripps can assure you that their respective financial forecasts will be realized or that their respective future financial results will not materially vary from the financial forecasts. Likewise, none of Journal, Scripps and/or Journal Media Group can assure you that Journal Media Group’s financial models or the financial models of Scripps following the transactions will be realized or that their respective future financial results will not materially vary from the financial models. The financial forecasts and models cover multiple years and such information by its nature becomes less predictive with each succeeding year as the assumptions in early periods have a compounding effect on the forecasts and models shown for later periods.

The financial forecasts and models do not take into account any circumstances or events occurring after the date they were prepared. Journal, Scripps and Journal Media Group do not intend to update or revise the financial forecasts or models. The 

98

financial forecasts and models are forward-looking statements. For more information on factors which may cause Journal’s, Scripps’ and Journal Media Group's future financial results to materially vary from those projected in the financial forecasts and models, see “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” beginning on page 49 and “Risk Factors” beginning on page 32, as well as Journal’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 29, 2013, Scripps’ Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, Journal’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 28, 2014, Scripps’ Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2014, and respective future SEC filings for a description of risk factors related to Journal's and Scripps' businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or release any revisions to these financial forecasts or models to reflect any events or circumstances after the date they were prepared or to reflect the occurrence of events that were unanticipated at the time.

Journal Unaudited Prospective Financial Information

In the course of their mutual due diligence, Journal provided Scripps with non-public financial forecasts for Journal’s newspaper business and Journal’s broadcast business for fiscal years 2014 through 2020, which forecasts are referred to as "Journal broadcast business management forecasts" and "Journal newspaper business management forecasts," respectively. The Journal broadcast business management forecasts and Journal newspaper business management forecasts are collectively referred to as the "Journal forecast."

The Scripps statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 includes the results of the Granite Acquisition for the period from June 16, 2014 through September 30, 2014. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations that follows for the year ended December 31, 2013 has been derived from the Scripps Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statement of Operations as adjusted to give effect to the Scripps newspapers spin-off (see Scripps pro forma information on page 147) for the year ended December 31, 2013, the Granite historical combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013, which were previously filed by Scripps with the SEC on Form 8-K/A dated June 16, 2014 and the Journal Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations as adjusted to give effect to the Journal newspapers spin-off (see Journal pro forma information on page 164) for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information that follows for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 has been derived from Scripps Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations as adjusted to give effect to the Scripps newspapers spin-off (see Scripps pro forma information on page 148), the Journal Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations as adjusted to give effect to the Journal newspapers spin-off (see Journal pro forma information on page 163) for the three quarters September 28, 2014 and the Granite historical consolidated financial information for the period January 1, 2014 to June 15, 2014.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information that follows as of September 30, 2014 has been derived from Scripps Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as adjusted to give effect to the Scripps newspapers spin-off (see Scripps pro forma information on page 146) and from the Journal Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as adjusted to give effect to the Journal newspapers spin-off (see Journal pro forma information on page 162). 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 has been prepared as though the Granite and Journal acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2013. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet information as of September 30, 2014 has been prepared as if the Journal broadcast acquisition occurred as of September 30, 2014. The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and assumptions that management of Scripps believes are reasonable. Such adjustments are estimates and are subject to change.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are provided for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual results of operations or the financial position of the combined company would be had the transaction occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future combined results of operations or combined financial position. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect any cost savings or other synergies that Scripps believes could have been achieved had the transactions been completed on the dates indicated.

The transactions will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with Scripps treated as the accounting acquiror. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the deemed purchase price has been allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based upon their respective fair values with any excess deemed purchase price allocated to goodwill. The adjustments to estimated fair values included herein are based upon a preliminary review of the purchased assets of Journal. We expect to complete at a later date appraisals of Journal assets at the level of detail necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocation. The final purchase price determination and allocation based upon these appraisals may be materially different from that reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements presented herein.

In addition, the final purchase price of Scripps’ acquisition of Journal will not be known until the date of closing of the transactions and could vary materially from the preliminary purchase price. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may be materially different from the preliminary unaudited pro forma adjustments presented. The actual amounts recorded as of the completion of the transactions may differ materially from the information presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements as a result of several factors, including the following:

|   
---|---  
•| changes in Journal's net assets between the pro forma balance sheet date of September 30, 2014 and the closing of the transactions, which could impact the preliminary estimated purchase price or the preliminary estimated fair value as of the effective date of the transactions;  
|   
---|---  
•| changes in the price of Scripps' Class A common shares;  
|   
---|---  
•| the value of the combined company at the effective date of the transactions; and  
|   
---|---  
•| other changes in net assets that may have occurred prior to the completion of the transactions, which could cause material differences in the information presented.  

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements constitute forward-looking information and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 32 and "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements" beginning on page 49.

The E.W. Scripps Company

Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements 

Note 1 — Basis of Pro Forma Presentation

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements present the pro forma condensed combined financial position and results of operations of the combined company based upon the historical financial statements of Scripps and Journal, as adjusted to reflect the spin-off of their newspaper business, after giving effect to the transactions, including the pro forma adjustments described in these notes, and are intended to reflect the impact of the transactions on Scripps' combined financial statements. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared using and should be read in conjunction with the respective audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements of Scripps for the year ended December 31, 2013 and as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and Journal for the year ended December 29, 2013 and as of for the three quarters ended September 28, 2014. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of future cost savings due to operating efficiencies or revenue synergies expected to result from the transactions. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 has been derived from the Scripps Unaudited Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations as adjusted to give effect to the Scripps newspapers spin-off (see Scripps pro forma information on page 147) for the year ended December 31, 2013, the Granite historical consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2013, which were previously filed by Scripps with the SEC on Form 8-K/A dated June 16, 2014, and the Journal Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as adjusted to give effect to the Journal newspapers spin-off (see Journal pro forma information on page 164) for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2013.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information that follows for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 has been derived from Scripps Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations as adjusted to give effect to the Scripps newspapers spin-off (see Scripps pro forma information on page 146), the Journal Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations as adjusted to give effect to the Journal newspapers spin-off (see Journal pro forma information on page 163) for the three quarters ended September 28, 2014, and the Granite historical combined financial information for the period January 1, 2014 to June 15, 2014. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information that follows as of September 30, 2014 has been derived from the Scripps Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as adjusted to give effect to the Scripps newspapers spin-off (see Scripps pro forma information on page 146) and from the Journal Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as adjusted to give effect to the Journal newspapers spin-off (see Journal pro forma information on page 163). Since the Granite acquisition occurred prior to September 30, 2014, the Scripps balance sheet already reflects the acquisition of Granite.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting with Scripps considered the accounting acquirer of Journal.

For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, a blended statutory tax rate of 38.0% has been used. This does not reflect the combined company’s expected effective tax rate, which will include other tax charges and benefits, and does not take into account any historical or possible future tax events that may impact the combined company.

Note 2 — Pro Forma Adjustments

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect the allocation of the preliminary estimated purchase price to identifiable assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed related to Journal, with the excess recorded as goodwill. The preliminary purchase price allocation in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements is based upon an estimated purchase price of approximately $450 million. We considered several alternatives to estimate the purchase price, including the current value of Scripps shares times the estimated number of Scripps shares to be issued to Journal shareholders on the closing of the acquisition. However, the current value of Scripps shares is not reflective of the value Journal shareholders will receive in the merger, as the merger will occur after payment of the $60 million special dividend to Scripps shareholders and the distribution of the Scripps newspaper business to Scripps shareholders.

<a name="s236B48733EF5E6D2E51A50CF9E491A53"></a>

We determined that the enterprise value of the Journal broadcast business, less debt and debt-like items, was the best estimate of the purchase price for use in the pro forma information. The estimated enterprise value was used to establish the exchange ratios in the merger, and was based upon discounted cash flows and earnings multiples valuation methods. The final purchase price will be based the share price of the Scripps shares at the acquisition closing date times the number of Scripps shares issued to the Journal shareholders. A $1.00 change in the ex-dividend share price of the Scripps shares issued to the Journal shareholders would result in an approximately $26 million change in the purchase price, most of which would be an adjustment to goodwill. 

The final purchase price allocation will depend upon on the actual net tangible assets and intangible assets and liabilities that exist as of the date of completion of the transactions. Accordingly, the pro forma purchase price adjustments are preliminary and are subject to further adjustments as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. Upon completion of the transactions, final valuations will be performed. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed will result in adjustments to the combined balance sheet or statement of operations. The estimated intangible values could be impacted by changes in assumptions that may occur prior to the completion of the transactions, including changes in the regulatory or future business environment or assumptions such as the discount rate utilized in the analyses. None of these changes is expected to materially impact the amounts reflected in the pro forma presentation.

For purposes of these Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed for the acquisition of Journal (in thousands):  

---  
| | |   
Assets:|   
Current assets| $| 63,500|   

Property, plant and equipment| 123,000|   

Other assets| 18,528|   

Intangible assets| 307,000|   

Goodwill| 285,515|   

Total assets acquired| 797,543|   

Current liabilities| (78,732| )  
Long-term debt (including current portion)| (153,789| )  
Other long-term liabilities| (55,022| )  
Deferred tax liabilities| (60,000| )  
Net purchase price| $| 450,000|   

Of the $307 million allocated to intangible assets, $141 million was for FCC licenses, which we expect to have an indefinite life and therefore will not be amortized. Of the remaining balance, $135 million was allocated to television network affiliation relationships with an estimated amortization period of 20 years. The remaining balance of $31 million was allocated to advertiser relationships with an estimated amortization period of 10 years.

The goodwill of $286 million arising from the transactions consists largely of the portion of the $35 million of annual synergies attributable to the broadcast business and economies of scale expected from the acquisition. We will treat the Journal broadcast acquisition as a purchase of stock for income tax purposes with no step-up in the assets acquired. The goodwill will not be deductible for income tax purposes.

Special dividend

In accordance with master agreement the Scripps shareholders will receive a special dividend in the aggregate amount of $60 million immediately prior to the completion of the broadcast acquisition.

Adjustments to Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2014 - Broadcast Acquisition

Certain reclassifications have been made to the presentation of the Journal historical balance sheet, as adjusted to reflect the spin-off of its newspapers as discontinued operations, to conform to the presentation used in the unaudited pro forma financial information.

<a name="s236B48733EF5E6D2E51A50CF9E491A53"></a>

|   
---|---  
1.| Reflects adjustment to record identifiable tangible and intangible assets of Journal at their preliminary estimated fair value. The allocation of the purchase price is subject to change as the appraisals are completed.   

|   
---|---  
2.| Reflects $60 million adjustment to record deferred taxes for the difference between the book and tax basis of assets acquired as a result of the purchase price allocation. The preliminary estimate of the deferred tax adjustment resulting from the purchase accounting adjustments was calculated at a tax rate of 38.0% representing Scripps' best estimate of its statutory income tax rate for all tax jurisdictions. In addition, after the $60 million pro forma adjustment and the $12 million adjustment for deferred taxes for deductible transaction costs (see adjustment 4), deferred taxes is a net deferred tax liability of $7.3 million which has been reclassified to long-term deferred tax liability.  

|   
---|---  
3.| Reflects $3.0 million of additional deferred financing costs for the $200 million increase in Scripps term loan B. Scripps committed financing is described on page 116.  

|   
---|---  
4.| Reflects the impact of transaction-related expense to be incurred on the pro forma condensed combined balance sheet. As of September 30, 2014, the combined company expects to pay total transaction-related costs of approximately $52 million. The combined company incurred $10 million of transaction-related costs through September 30, 2014, which is reflected in the historical retained earnings balance. For pro forma purposes, retained earnings was decreased by $42 million for transaction-related costs not yet incurred with an offsetting decrease in cash. The adjustment to retained earnings was offset by $12 million of expected tax benefits (deferred tax asset) for the portion of transaction-related expenses that are expected to be deductible, which are included as an adjustment to Other Liabilities.  

|   
---|---  
5.| Represents an estimate of the number of unrestricted Scripps Class A common shares that would have been issued to acquire Journal as of September 30, 2014, pursuant to the exchange ratio in the master agreement. The number of Scripps Class A common shares to be issued for pro forma presentation purposes was calculated based on the number of shares of Journal common stock issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2014, as illustrated below:  

---  
| |   
Journal common shares outstanding as of September 30, 2014|   
Class A common shares| 45,099,084|   

Class B common shares| 5,821,926|   

|   
Total shares outstanding| 50,921,010|   

Exchange ratio| 0.5176|   

|   
Pro forma Scripps class A common shares issued| 26,356,715|   

|   
---|---  
6.| Represents pro forma adjustment to long-term debt for the $200 million increase in Scripps term loan B. Scripps committed financing is described on page 116. The proceeds from the loan will be used to refinance of all of Journal's debt with the exception of Journal's Unsecured 7.25% Subordinated Notes Payable. If the broadcast acquisition had occurred on September 30, 2014, Scripps would have used $13 million in proceeds to repay the outstanding balance of Journal's revolving credit facility, $128 million to repay the outstanding balance of Journal's term loan and the $59 million remainder for cash for working capital.  

If the broadcast acquisition had occurred as of September 30, 2014, the carrying amount of Scripps' long-term debt would have been as follows:  

---  
| | |   
(in thousands)|   
Scripps variable credit facility| $| —|   

Scripps term loan| 398,500|   

Unsecured 7.25% subordinated notes| 13,279|   

|   
Total debt| 411,779|   

Current portion of long-term debt| 6,641|   

|   
Long-term debt (less current portion)| $| 405,138|

Adjustments to Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 - Granite Acquisition

Certain reclassifications have been made to the presentation of the Acquired Granite Stations' historical Statements of Operations to conform to the presentation used in the unaudited pro forma financial information.

|   
---|---  
1.| Reflects an adjustment to depreciation and amortization expense resulting from the fair value adjustments to the Acquired Granite Stations’ property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.

---|---  
2.| Income tax effects of the pro forma adjustments are reflected at Scripps' best estimate of the statutory income tax rate.  

Adjustments to Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 - Broadcast Acquisition

Certain reclassifications have been made to the presentation of the Journal historical Statements of Operations, as adjusted to reflect the spin-off of its newspapers as discontinued operations, to conform to the presentation used in the unaudited pro forma financial information.

a.Reflects an adjustment to depreciation expense resulting from the fair value adjustments to Journal's property, plant and equipment. The depreciation was determined on a straight-line method. 

b.Reflects an adjustment to amortization expense resulting from the fair value adjustments to Journal's intangible assets. The amortization was determined on a straight-line method with a estimated useful life of 20 years for affiliation agreements and 10 years for advertiser relationships.

c.Reflects adjustments to interest expense associated with long-term debt to show the acquisition of Journal and the refinancing of Journal's debt with the exception of Journal's Unsecured 7.25% Subordinated Notes Payable, as if the broadcast acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2013. The Scripps loan agreement bears interest at LIBOR, with an 0.75% floor, plus a fixed margin of 2.50%. For 2013 the weighted average interest rate on the Scripps loan agreement was 3.7%. A 12.5 basis point change in market interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense approximately $0.5 million.

d.Represents $0.6 million adjustment for additional amortization of loan fees related to refinancing of Scripps described above.

e.Income tax effects of the pro forma adjustments are reflected at 38.0%, Scripps' best estimate of the statutory income tax rate.

f.Pro forma earnings per share and pro forma weighted-average shares outstanding are based on the weighted-average number of shares of Scripps and Journal stock for the year ended December 31, 2013, adjusted for an assumed conversion ratio of 0.5176 Scripps class A common shares for each share of Journal common stock. 

While the actual future impact of potential dilution from shares of common stock related to equity awards granted to employees under Scripps and Journal equity plans will depend on various factors, including employees who may change employment from one company to another, we do not currently estimate that the future dilutive impact is material. 

Adjustments to Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 - Granite Acquisition

The E.W. Scripps Company 

Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1 — Basis of Pro Forma Presentation

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements present the pro forma condensed combined financial position and results of operations of Scripps after giving effect to the spin-off of Scripps Newspapers. Scripps Newspapers is the business representing the principal publishing operations of Scripps, as described below. 

Scripps Newspapers consists of daily and community newspapers in 13 markets across the United States. The newspapers earn revenue primarily from the sale of advertising to local and national advertisers and newspaper subscription fees. The newspapers operate in mid-size markets, focusing on news coverage within their local markets. Advertising and subscription revenues provide substantially all of the operating revenues for each newspaper market, and employee, newspaper distribution and newsprint costs are the primary expenses at each newspaper. The daily newspapers published by the Company are the Abilene (TX) Reporter-News, the Anderson (SC) Independent-Mail, the Corpus Christi (TX) Caller-Times, the Evansville (IN) Courier & Press, the Henderson (KY) Gleaner, the Kitsap (WA) Sun, the Knoxville (TN) News Sentinel, the Memphis (TN) Commercial Appeal, the Naples (FL) Daily News, the Redding (CA) Record-Searchlight, the San Angelo (TX) Standard-Times, the Treasure Coast (FL) News/Press/Tribune, the Ventura County (CA) Star and the Wichita Falls (TX) Times Record News. The business also include a 40% ownership in the Albuquerque Publishing Company, which publishes the Albuquerque Journal (NM). 

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared using and should be read in conjunction with the audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements of Scripps for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of future cost savings due to operating efficiencies or revenue synergies expected to result from the transactions. 

Note 2 — Pro Forma Adjustments

Adjustments to Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2014

a.Reflects adjustment to eliminate the assets and liabilities to be distributed in the Scripps newspaper spin-off.

Adjustments to the Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014

a.Reflects adjustment to present the operations of the Scripps newspapers as discontinued operations. Excluded from these amounts are certain general corporate overhead expenses not specifically related to the the Scripps newspapers. Such general corporate expenses do not meet the requirements to be presented in discontinued operations, and thus are presented as part of Scripps' continuing operations.

The provision for income taxes was determined using the U.S. GAAP intraperiod allocation rules.

Journal Communications, Inc.

Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

Note 1 - Basis of Pro Forma Presentation

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements present the pro forma condensed combined financial position and results of operations of Journal after giving effect to the spin-off of JRN Newspapers. JRN Newspapers is the business representing the principal publishing operations of Journal, as described below. 

JRN Newspapers consists of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which serves as the only major daily newspaper for the Milwaukee metropolitan area, and several community publications-primarily in southeastern Wisconsin-as well as print facilities in West Milwaukee and Waupaca, Wisconsin. JRN Newspaper’s operations are conducted through Journal's wholly-owned subsidiaries, Journal Sentinel, Inc. and Journal Community Publishing Group, Inc.

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared using and should be read in conjunction with the respective audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements of Journal for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2013, December 30, 2012 and December 25, 2011 and as of and for the three quarters ended September 28, 2014. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of future cost savings due to operating efficiencies or revenue synergies expected to result from the transactions. 

Note 2 - Pro Forma Adjustments

Adjustments to Balance Sheet as of September 28, 2014

|   
---|---  
a.| Reflects adjustment to eliminate the assets and liabilities to be distributed in the Journal newspapers spin-off.  
|   
---|---  
b.| Reflects the contribution of $10 million of cash to the Journal newspapers prior to the Journal newspapers spin-off pursuant to the master agreement. Since Journal does not have cash on hand to make the distribution of cash, it is assumed that the cash will be funded by a borrowing under the Journal secured revolving credit facility.   
|   
---|---  
c.| Reflects the estimated tax on the spin-off of Journal Newspapers. The spin-off of the Journal Newspapers is taxable to Journal.  

Adjustments to the Statement of Operations for the years ended December 29, 2013, December 30, 2012 and December 25, 2011 and for the three quarters ended September 28, 2014

|   
---|---  
a.| Reflects adjustment to present the operations of the Journal newspapers as discontinued operations. Excluded from these amounts are certain general corporate overhead expenses not specifically related to the Journal newspapers business. Such general corporate expenses do not meet the requirements to be presented in discontinued operations, and thus are presented as part of Journal's continuing operations.  

The provision for income taxes was determined using the U.S. GAAP intraperiod allocation rules. 

|   
---|---  
b.| Reflects adjustments to interest expense associated with the assumed borrowing to fund the $10 million cash contribution to Journal newspapers as if the contribution had occurred on January 1, 2013. The Journal loan agreement bears interest at a variable rate. As of December 29, 2013, the interest rate was 2.23%. A 12.5 basis point change in market interest rates would not materially impact annual interest expense.  
|   
---|---  
c.| Reflects income tax effects of the pro forma adjustments and historical income are reflected at 40.0%, the best estimate of the statutory income tax rate.  

Note 3 - Other supplemental pro forma cash flow information

Subsequent to the Journal newspapers spin-off the future cash flows of the remaining business, comprised of the broadcast business and corporate overhead, will be different from the historical cash flows of Journal. The historical cash flows provided by operating activities of Journal were $53 million and $75 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively. Historical cash flow provided by operating activities of Journal was $56 million for the three quarters ended September 28, 2014. Management of Journal has estimated that pro forma cash flows provided by operating activities, as adjusted to reflect Journal's 

167

<a name="s515669ADE09B52BECB2850CF9E49FB24"></a>

newspapers as discontinued operations, would have been $32 million and $57 million for 2013 and 2012, respectively and $46 million for the three quarters ended September 28, 2014.

This supplemental pro forma cash flow information is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect the costs of any integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of future cost savings due to operating efficiencies or revenue synergies expected to result from the transactions.

JOURNAL MEDIA GROUP

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information of Journal Media Group is based upon the historical carve-out financial statements of Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers adjusted to give effect to (1) the Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers spin-off from their respective parent companies, Scripps and Journal, (2) the contribution of cash from Journal to JRN Newspapers prior to the spin-off, and (3) the distribution of Journal Media Group common stock to the shareholders of Scripps and Journal.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 was prepared using (1) the audited combined statement of operations of Scripps Newspapers for the year ended December 31, 2013 and (2) the audited combined statement of operations of JRN Newspapers for the year ended December 29, 2013, each of which is included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, was prepared using (1) the unaudited combined statement of operations of Scripps Newspapers for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and (2) the unaudited combined statement of operations of JRN Newspapers for the three quarters ended September 28, 2014, each of which is included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet was prepared using (1) the unaudited combined balance sheet of Scripps Newspapers as of September 30, 2014 and (2) the unaudited combined balance sheet of JRN Newspapers as of September 28, 2014, each of which is included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based upon the assumptions and adjustments in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 gives effect to the transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2013. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet as of September 30, 2014 gives effect to the transactions as if they had occurred on September 30, 2014.

The transactions will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with Scripps Newspapers treated as the accounting acquirer. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the deemed purchase price has been allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based upon their respective fair values with any excess deemed purchase price allocated to goodwill. The adjustments to estimated fair values included herein are based upon a preliminary review of the purchased assets of JRN Newspapers. Journal Media Group expects to complete, at a later date, appraisals of JRN Newspapers assets at the level of detail necessary to finalize the required purchase price allocation. The final purchase price determination and allocation based upon these appraisals may be materially different from that reflected in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements presented herein.

Upon closing the transactions, Journal Media Group expects to implement a plan to integrate the operations of Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers which will generate certain non-recurring charges. Management cannot currently identify the timing, nature and amount of such charges. Such charges (which may be substantial) could affect the results of Journal Media Group in the period in which such charges are incurred. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not include the realization of any cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructuring activities which might result from the transactions. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should be read in conjunction with the historical carve-out financial statements and accompanying notes of Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers that are included herein.

Journal Media Group expects to experience changes in its ongoing cost structure when it becomes an independent, publicly-traded company. For example, Scripps and Journal currently provide many corporate functions on behalf of Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers, including, but not limited to, finance, legal, insurance, information technology, and human resources. The historical carve-out financial statements include allocations of these expenses from Scripps and Journal of $58.5 million and $68.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and year ended December 31, 2013, respectively. Scripps and Journal believe these costs may not be representative of the future costs Journal Media Group will incur as an independent public company. 

Costs related to the transactions of approximately $10 million have been incurred by Scripps and Journal for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. These costs include accounting, legal, consulting and advisory fees. Scripps and Journal 

169

* * *

<a name="s4542EE915AA5566C5EEC50CF9E4D7304"></a>

have assumed all of these transaction costs incurred to date and anticipate that they will be responsible for all similar costs incurred prior to the transactions. Therefore, in the historical and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, no transaction costs incurred by Scripps or Journal were allocated to Scripps Newspapers or JRN Newspapers or otherwise reflected in the pro forma financial results. 

Scripps and Journal currently estimate the costs that will be incurred during Journal Media Group's transition to being a stand-alone public company will not be material. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations do not include these estimated costs as the costs are not expected to have an ongoing impact on operating results; they are projected amounts based on subjective estimates and assumptions, and would not be factually supportable. It is anticipated that substantially all of these costs will be incurred within 18 months of the completion of the transactions. The transition-related costs include, but are not limited to, the following:

|   
---|---  
•| incremental accounting, tax and other professional costs pertaining to establishing Journal Media Group as a stand-alone public company; and  

|   
---|---  
•| costs to separate corporate information systems. Due to the scope and complexity of these activities, the amount of these costs could increase or decrease materially and the timing of incurrence could change.   

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial condition of Journal Media Group.

Journal Media Group

Notes to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Statements 

Note 1 - Basis of Pro Forma Presentation

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements present the pro forma condensed combined financial position and results of operations of Journal Media Group based upon the historical carve-out financial statements of Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers, after giving effect to the transactions, including the pro forma adjustments described in these notes, and are intended to reflect the impact of the transactions on Journal Media Group's condensed combined financial statements. Journal Media Group has no assets or liabilities as of or for any of the periods presented.

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements have been prepared using and should be read in conjunction with the respective audited and unaudited combined financial statements of Scripps Newspapers for the year ended December 31, 2013 and as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and JRN Newspapers for the year ended December 29, 2013 and as of and for the three quarters ended September 28, 2014. The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only and do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of future cost savings due to operating efficiencies or revenue synergies expected to result from the transactions.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 was prepared using (1) the audited combined statement of operations of Scripps Newspapers for the year ended December 31, 2013 and (2) the audited combined statement of operations of JRN Newspapers for the year ended December 29, 2013, each of which is included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, was prepared using (1) the unaudited combined statement of operations of Scripps Newspapers for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and (2) the unaudited statement of operations of JRN Newspapers for the three quarters ended September 28, 2014, each of which is included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet was prepared using (1) the unaudited combined balance sheet of Scripps Newspapers as of September 30, 2014 and (2) the unaudited combined balance sheet of JRN Newspapers as of September 28, 2014, each of which is included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based upon the assumptions and adjustments in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 gives effect to the transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2013. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet gives effect to the transactions as if they had occurred on September 30, 2014.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements were prepared using the acquisition method of accounting with Scripps Newspapers considered the accounting acquirer of Journal Newspapers.

Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers historical combined financial statements have been “carved-out” from the consolidated financial statements of the respective parent companies and reflect assumptions and allocations made by such companies. Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers historical carve-out financial statements include all revenues, costs, assets and liabilities that are directly attributable to the respective businesses. In addition, certain expenses reflected in Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers carve-out financial statements are an allocation of corporate expenses from the respective parents. Such expenses include, but are not limited to, centralized support functions including finance, legal, information technology, human resources, and insurance as well as stock-based compensation. These expenses have been allocated to Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers on the basis of direct usage when identifiable and allocated based upon on a number of utilization measures including headcount, square footage, and proportionate effort. Where determinations based on utilization are impracticable, other methods and criteria that are believed to be reasonable estimates of costs attributable to the companies, such as revenues.

The actual costs that may have been incurred if Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newpapers had been stand-alone companies would depend on a number of factors, including the chosen organizational structure and strategic decisions made as to information technology and infrastructure requirements. As such, Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers respective combined financial statements do not necessarily reflect what the financial condition and results of operations would have been had Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers operated as stand-alone companies during the periods or at the date presented.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements contain only adjustments that are factually supportable and directly attributable and do not reflect the costs of any integration activities or benefits that may result from realization of future cost savings from operating efficiencies or revenue synergies expected to result from the transactions.

For purposes of the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements, a blended statutory tax rate of 38.0% has been used. This does not reflect Journal Media Group’s expected effective tax rate, which will include other tax charges and benefits, and does not take into account any historical or possible future tax events that may impact the combined company.

Note 2 - Pro Forma Adjustments

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet has been adjusted to reflect the allocation of the preliminary estimated purchase price of identifiable assets to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed related to JRN Newspapers, with the excess recorded as goodwill. The preliminary purchase price allocation in these unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements is based upon an estimated purchase price of approximately $135 million. This amount was derived based on the business enterprise value of JRN Newspapers as of July 2014. As the shares of Journal Media Group were not publicly traded as of September 30, 2014, it is not possible to use a current stock price to determine the fair value of the consideration for the acquisition. The estimated enterprise value was used to establish the exchange ratios in the merger, and was based upon discounted cash flows and earnings multiples valuation methods. The final purchase price will be based on the share price of the Journal Media Group shares at the acquisition closing date times the number of Journal Media Group shares issued to the Journal shareholders. A $1.00 change in the share price of the Journal Media Group shares issued to the Journal shareholders would result in an approximately $10 million change in the purchase price, most of which would be an adjustment to goodwill. 

The final purchase price allocation will depend upon the actual net tangible assets and intangible assets and liabilities that exist as of the date of completion of the transactions. Accordingly, the pro forma purchase price adjustments are preliminary and are subject to further adjustments as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed will result in adjustments to the condensed combined balance sheet and/or statement of operations. The estimated intangible values could be impacted by changes in assumptions that may occur prior to the completion of the transactions, including changes in the regulatory or future business environment or assumptions such as the discount rate utilized in the analyses. None of these changes is expected to materially impact the amounts reflected in the pro forma presentation. 

For purposes of these pro forma condensed combined financial statements the following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed for the acquisition of JRN Newspapers (in thousands):  

---  
| | | |   
Assets:|  |   
Current assets|  | $| 30,176|   

Property, plant and equipment|  | 81,000|   

Intangible assets|  | 26,000|   

Goodwill|  | 43,374|   

Total assets acquired|  | 180,550|   

Current liabilities|  | (27,873| )  
Long-term liabilities|  | (17,677| )  
Net purchase price|  | $| 135,000|   

Of the $26 million allocated to intangible assets, $10 million was allocated to trade name and trademarks with an estimated amortization period of 25 years and $16 million was allocated to advertiser and subscriber relationships with an estimated amortization period of 10 years. 

The goodwill of $43 million consists largely of the portion of the $35 million of annual synergies attributable to the newspaper business and economies of scale expected from the acquisition. Scripps will treat the transaction as a purchase of assets for income tax purposes, resulting in a step-up in the assets acquired. The goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Adjustments to the Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2014

|   
---|---  
1.| Pursuant to the master agreement Journal will contribute $10 million to JRN Newspapers immediately prior to the Journal Newspapers spin-off.   

|   
---|---  
2.| Reflects adjustment to record identifiable tangible and intangible assets of JRN Newspapers at their preliminary estimated fair value. The allocation of the purchase price is subject to change as the appraisals are completed.   

|   
---|---  
3.| Reflects adjustment to remove certain liabilities included in the Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers carve-out financial statements that pursuant to the master agreement will not be included in the newspaper spin-offs. Pursuant to the master agreement pension plans currently sponsored directly by the Memphis newspaper operations of Scripps with a balance of $3.0 million will be retained by Scripps and therefore have been removed. The accumulated other comprehensive loss of $8.9 million related to the pension plans sponsored directly by the Memphis newspaper operations is part of the total equity pro forma adjustment. The $4.1 million liability associated with the withdrawal from the Graphics Communication International Union Employer Retirement Fund ("GCIU") will be retained by Scripps and also has been removed. Journal Media Group will be responsible for any potential future liability, which is unknown at this time, in the event of a mass-withdrawal liability.  

|   
---|---  
4.| Reflects adjustment to remove the related party note as the related party lending arrangement will be terminated and all outstanding balances will be contributed to capital upon consummation of the transactions pursuant to the master agreement.  

Other

The pro forma number of shares outstanding of Journal Media Group as of September 30, 2014 is 24.1 million shares based on the number of share outstanding of Scripps and Journal. As of the date of completion of the transactions, each parent’s net investment in Journal Media Group will be distributed to each Parent’s stockholders through the distribution of all the common stock of Journal Media Group. 

•Scripps shareholders will receive 0.2500 shares of Journal Media Group common stock for each share of Scripps common stock they hold for a total of 14.2 million shares of Journal Media Group.

•Journal shareholders will receive 0.1950 shares of Journal Media Group common stock for each share of Journal common stock they hold for a total of 9.9 million shares of Journal Media Group.

Adjustments to Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2013

|   
---|---  
a.| Reflects an adjustment to eliminate the expense related to 1) $0.6 million of expense for the defined benefit pension plans of the Memphis and Knoxville newspaper operations, 2) the allocation of $2.9 million of Scripps pension expense and 3) the allocation $1.5 million of Journal pension expense, all of which defined benefit plans will be retained by Scripps pursuant to the master agreement.   

|   
---|---  
b.| Reflects an adjustment to depreciation expense resulting from the fair value adjustments to JRN Newspapers property, plant and equipment. The depreciation was determined on a straight-line basis with an estimated useful life of 30 years for buildings and 7 years for equipment.   

|   
---|---  
c.| Reflects an adjustment to amortization expense resulting from the fair value adjustments to JRN Newspapers intangible assets. The amortization was determined on a straight-line basis with a estimated useful life of 25 years for trade names and 10 years for advertiser relationships.   

|   
---|---  
d.| The provision for income taxes reflected in the Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers historical carve-out financial statements was determined as if they had filed separate, stand-alone income tax returns in each relevant jurisdiction. In determining the tax rate to apply to pro forma adjustments, the applicable estimated statutory rate based on the jurisdiction in which the adjustment relates was used.  

|   
---|---  
e.| Pro forma earnings per share and pro forma weighted-average shares outstanding are based on the weighted-average number of shares of Scripps and Journal stock for the year ended December 31, 2013 adjusted for an assumed distribution ratio as follows:   

176

* * *

<a name="s4542EE915AA5566C5EEC50CF9E4D7304"></a>

•Scripps shareholders will receive 0.2500 shares of Journal Media Group common stock for each share of Scripps common stock they hold

•Journal shareholders will receive 0.1950 shares of Journal Media Group common stock for each share of Journal common stock they hold

While the actual future impact of potential dilution from shares of common stock related to equity awards granted to employees under Scripps and Journal equity plans will depend on various factors, including employees who may change employment from one company to another, Journal and Scripps do not currently estimate that the future dilutive impact is material. 

Adjustments to Statement of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014

|   
---|---  
a.| Reflects an adjustment to eliminate the expense related to 1) the $0.3 million of expense for the defined benefit pension plans of the Memphis and Knoxville newspaper operations, 2) the allocation of $1.6 million of Scripps pension expense and 3) the allocation $1.2 million of Journal pension expense, all of which defined benefit plans will be retained by Scripps pursuant to the master agreement.

|   
---|---  
d.| The provision for income taxes reflected in the Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers historical carve-out financial statements was determined as if they had filed separate, stand-alone income tax returns in each relevant jurisdiction.

•Scripps shareholders will receive 0.2500 shares of Journal Media Group common stock for each share of Scripps common stock they hold

•Journal shareholders will receive 0.1950 shares of Journal Media Group common stock for each share of Journal common stock they hold

While the actual future impact of potential dilution from shares of common stock related to equity awards granted to employees under Scripps and Journal equity plans will depend on various factors, including employees who may change employment from one company to another, Journal and Scripps do not currently estimate that the future dilutive impact is material.

Titles: MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSACTIONS

<a name="s23129B9C4500F082D69450CFB37D1D29"></a>

MATERIAL U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSACTIONS

The following is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to Scripps and Journal, and to the holders of Scripps common shares and Journal common stock, in connection with the Scripps newspaper contribution, Scripps newspaper spin-off, Journal newspaper contribution, Journal newspaper spin-off, Scripps newspaper merger, Scripps special dividend, Journal newspaper merger, and broadcast merger, as applicable. This summary is based on the Code, the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect and available as of the date of this information statement and subject to change at any time, possibly with retroactive effect. Any such change could affect the tax consequences described below.

This summary is limited to holders of Scripps, Scripps Spinco, Journal, or Journal Spinco common shares that are U.S. Holders, as defined immediately below. A “U.S. Holder” is a beneficial owner of common shares that is, for U.S. federal income tax purposes:

|   
---|---  
•| an individual who is a citizen or a resident of the United States;  
|   
---|---  
•| a corporation, or other entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, created or organized under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia;  
|   
---|---  
•| an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or  
|   
---|---  
•| a trust, if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (ii) it has a valid election in place under applicable Treasury Regulations to be treated as a United States person.  

This summary also does not discuss all tax considerations that may be relevant to shareholders in light of their particular circumstances, nor does it address the consequences to shareholders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws, such as:

|   
---|---  
•| dealers or traders in securities or currencies;  
|   
---|---  
•| regulated investment companies;  
|   
---|---  
•| real estate investment trusts;  
|   
---|---  
•| tax-exempt entities;  
|   
---|---  
•| banks, financial institutions or insurance companies;  
|   
---|---  
•| persons who acquired common shares pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options or otherwise as compensation;  
|   
---|---  
•| shareholders who own, or are deemed to own, at least 10% or more, by voting power or value, of the corporation’s equity;  
|   
---|---  
•| holders owning common shares as part of a position in a straddle or as part of a hedging, conversion or other risk reduction transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or  
|   
---|---  
•| a person that owns common shares through partnerships or other pass-through entities.  

This summary does not address the U.S. federal income tax consequences to shareholders who do not hold common shares as a capital asset, and does not discuss any alternative minimum tax consequences. Moreover, this summary does not address any state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences or any estate, gift or other non-income tax consequences.

If a partnership (or any other entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds common shares, the tax treatment of a partner in that partnership will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Such a partner or partnership should consult its own tax advisor as to its tax consequences.

YOU SHOULD CONSULT YOUR OWN TAX ADVISOR WITH RESPECT TO THE U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND NON-U.S. TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE TRANSACTIONS. THIS SUMMARY IS NOT INTENDED TO BE, NOR SHOULD IT BE CONSTRUED TO BE, LEGAL OR TAX ADVICE TO ANY PARTICULAR INVESTOR.

Scripps Newspaper Contribution and Scripps Newspaper Spin-Off

In connection with the transactions, Scripps expects to receive an opinion from the law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP that the Scripps newspaper contribution and Scripps newspaper spin-off will meet the requirements necessary for the spin-off to receive tax-free treatment under Sections 355, 368 and related provisions of the Code. The opinion will be based on, among other things, current tax law and assumptions and representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants made by Scripps Spinco, Journal Media Group and Scripps, which if incorrect in certain material respects, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by Baker & Hostetler LLP in its opinion. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants are incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or are violated in any material respect. The opinion of counsel will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. The opinion of counsel does not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the spin-off. 

Scripps and Scripps Spinco have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matters relating to the spin-off, and as a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to the conclusions set forth below. In that event, the consequences described below would not apply and holders of Scripps common shares who receive shares of Scripps Spinco common stock in the spin-off could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.

Assuming the spin-off satisfies the requirements necessary for the spin-off to qualify for tax-free treatment under Sections 355, 368 and related provisions of the Code, the following will describe the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to Scripps, Scripps Spinco and Scripps’ shareholders of the spin-off:

|   
---|---  
•| subject to the discussion below regarding Section 355(e), no gain or loss will be recognized by, and no amount will be includible in the income of, Scripps as a result of the distribution, other than with respect to any “excess loss account” or “intercompany transaction” required to be taken into account under Treasury regulations relating to consolidated returns;  

|   
---|---  
•| no gain or loss will be recognized by, or be includible in the income of, a holder of Scripps common shares, solely as a result of the receipt of Scripps Spinco common stock, except possibly with respect to cash received in the Scripps special dividend, discussed on page 120;  

|   
---|---  
•| the aggregate tax basis of the Scripps common shares and Scripps Spinco common stock in the hands of Scripps’ shareholders immediately after the spin-off will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Scripps common shares held by the holder immediately before the spin-off, allocated between the common shares of Scripps and Scripps Spinco common stock in proportion to their relative fair market values on the date of the spin-off; and   

|   
---|---  
•| the holding period of shares of the Scripps Spinco common stock received by Scripps’ shareholders will include the holding period of their Scripps common shares, provided that such shares are held as capital assets on the date of the spin-off.   

Scripps’ shareholders that have acquired different blocks of Scripps common shares at different times or at different prices should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of their aggregate adjusted basis among, and their holding period of, Scripps Spinco common stock distributed with respect to such blocks of Scripps common shares.

U.S. Treasury Regulations require certain shareholders that receive stock in a spin-off to attach to their respective U.S. federal income tax returns, for the year in which the spin-off occurs, a detailed statement setting forth certain information relating to the spin-off. Within a reasonable period of time after the distribution, Scripps expects to make available to its shareholders information pertaining to compliance with this requirement.

If the spin-off were not to qualify as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each Scripps shareholder that receives shares of Scripps Spinco common stock in the spin-off would be treated as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares, and the distribution of shares of Scripps Spinco common stock received with respect to a Scripps common share generally would be treated in the following manner:

|   
---|---  
•| first as a taxable dividend to the extent of the pro rata share of Scripps’ current and accumulated earnings and profits that is allocable to the Scripps common share, if any;   

|   
---|---  
•| then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholder’s tax basis in the Scripps share; and  

|   
---|---  
•| thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value.  

118

* * *

<a name="s23129B9C4500F082D69450CFB37D1D29"></a>

Additionally, each shareholder’s basis in the Scripps Spinco common stock would be equal to the fair market value of such stock on the date of the distribution, and such shareholder’s holding period in the Scripps Spinco common stock would begin on the date of the distribution. Furthermore, Scripps would recognize taxable gain if the fair market value of Scripps Spinco common stock exceeds Scripps’ tax basis in such stock.

Even if the spin-off otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code, it may be taxable to Scripps (but not Scripps’ shareholders) under Section 355(e) if 50% or more, by vote or value, of shares of Scripps Spinco common stock or Scripps common shares are acquired or issued as part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the spin-off. For this purpose, any acquisitions or issuances of Scripps common shares within two years before the spin-off, and any acquisitions or issuances of Scripps Spinco common stock or Scripps common shares within two years after the spin-off, generally are presumed to be part of such a plan, although Scripps Spinco or Scripps may be able to rebut that presumption. Even if these rules were to apply to cause the spin-off to be taxable to Scripps, it would remain tax-free to the Scripps shareholders.

In connection with the spin-off, Scripps Spinco, Journal Media Group and Scripps have entered into a tax matters agreement whereby Scripps Spinco, Journal Media Group, and Scripps agree to be subject to certain restrictions to preserve the tax-free nature of the spin-off. For a description of the tax matters agreements, see “Additional Agreements - Tax Matters Agreements” at page 140. 

Scripps Newspaper Merger

In connection with the transactions, Scripps expects to receive an opinion from the law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP that the Scripps newspaper merger will meet the requirements necessary for the merger to receive tax-free treatment under Sections 351 and/or 368 and related provisions of the Code. The opinion will be based on, among other things, current tax law and assumptions and representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants made by Scripps Spinco, Journal Media Group and Scripps, which if incorrect in certain material respects, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by Baker & Hostetler LLP in its opinion. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants are incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or are violated in any material respect. The opinion of counsel will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. The opinion of counsel does not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the merger.

Scripps and Scripps Spinco have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matters relating to the merger, and as a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to the conclusions set forth below. In that event, the consequences described below would not apply and holders of Scripps Spinco common stock who receive shares of Journal Media Group common stock in the merger could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.

Assuming the merger satisfies the requirements necessary for the merger to qualify for tax-free treatment under Sections 351 and/or 368 and related provisions of the Code, the following will describe the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to Scripps Spinco and Scripps Spinco’s shareholders of the merger:

|   
---|---  
•| no gain or loss will be recognized by, and no amount will be includible in the income of, Scripps Spinco or Journal Media Group as a result of the merger;  

|   
---|---  
•| no gain or loss will be recognized by, or be includible in the income of, a holder of shares of Scripps Spinco common stock, solely as a result of the receipt of Journal Media Group common stock, except with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional shares;  

|   
---|---  
•| the aggregate tax basis of the Journal Media Group common stock received in the merger (including any fractional shares deemed received and sold for cash as described below) by a holder will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Scripps Spinco common stock held by the holder immediately before the merger;   

|   
---|---  
•| the holding period of shares of the Journal Media Group common stock received by Scripps Spinco’s stockholders will include the holding period of their shares of Scripps Spinco common stock, provided that such shares are held as capital assets on the date of the merger; and   

|   
---|---  
•| a Scripps Spinco shareholder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of Journal Media Group common stock in the merger will be treated as having sold such fractional share for the amount of cash received and generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of such cash received and   

119

* * *

<a name="s23129B9C4500F082D69450CFB37D1D29"></a>

such stockholder’s adjusted tax basis in the fractional share. That gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the stockholder’s holding period for its Scripps Spinco common stock exceeds one year. 

Payments of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Journal Media Group common stock may, under certain circumstances, be subject to “backup withholding,” unless a U.S. Holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or a correct taxpayer identification number, and otherwise complies with the requirements of the backup withholding rules. Corporations will generally be exempt from backup withholding, but may be required to provide a certification to establish their entitlement to the exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and it may be refunded or credited against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability if the required information is timely supplied to the IRS.

Scripps Spinco’s shareholders that have different tax bases or holding periods for different blocks of Scripps Spinco common stock should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of their aggregate adjusted basis among, and their holding period of, Journal Media Group common stock received with respect to such blocks of Scripps Spinco common stock. 

If the merger were not to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each Scripps Spinco shareholder that receives shares of Journal Media Group common stock in the merger would be treated as recognizing taxable gain to the extent the fair market value of such shares exceeds such shareholder’s tax basis in its Scripps Spinco common stock. Additionally, each shareholder’s basis in the Journal Media Group common stock would be equal to its fair market value on the date of the merger and its holding period in the Journal Media Group common stock would begin on the date of the merger. 

Scripps Special Dividend

The cash received in the Scripps special dividend with respect to a Scripps common share generally will be treated in the following manner:

|   
---|---  
•| first as a taxable dividend to the extent of the pro rata share of Scripps’ current and accumulated earnings and profits that is allocable to the Scripps common share, if any (as of September 30, 2014, Scripps had no current or accumulated earnings and profits, and Scripps is expected not to have any current or accumulated earnings or profits for the taxable year in which the distribution is made);   

|   
---|---  
•| then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholder’s tax basis in the Scripps share; and  

|   
---|---  
•| thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value.  

Payments of cash in the Scripps special dividend may, under certain circumstances, be subject to “backup withholding,” unless a U.S. Holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or a correct taxpayer identification number, and otherwise complies with the requirements of the backup withholding rules. Corporations will generally be exempt from backup withholding, but may be required to provide a certification to establish their entitlement to the exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and it may be refunded or credited against a U.S. Holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability if the required information is timely supplied to the IRS. 

Journal Newspaper Contribution and Journal Newspaper Spin-Off

In connection with the transactions, Journal expects to receive an opinion from the law firm of Foley & Lardner LLP that the Journal newspaper contribution and Journal newspaper spin-off will meet the requirements necessary for the spin-off to qualify under Sections 355, 368 and related provisions of the Code. The opinion will be based on, among other things, current tax law and assumptions and representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants made by Journal Spinco, Journal Media Group and Journal, which if incorrect in certain material respects, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by Foley & Lardner LLP in its opinion. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants are incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or are violated in any material respect. The opinion of counsel will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. The opinion of counsel does not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the spin-off. 

Journal and Journal Spinco have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matters relating to the spin-off, and as a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to the conclusions set forth below. In that event, the consequences described below would not apply and holders of Journal common stock who receive shares of Journal Spinco common stock in the spin-off could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.

Assuming the spin-off satisfies the requirements necessary for the spin-off to qualify under Sections 355, 368 and related provisions of the Code, the following will describe the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to Journal, Journal Spinco and Journal’s shareholders of the spin-off:

|   
---|---  
•| as a result of the application of Section 355(e), Journal will recognize gain but not loss on the distribution of shares of Journal Spinco common stock to the extent the fair market value of such shares exceeds Journal’s tax basis in such shares;  

|   
---|---  
•| subject to the discussion above regarding Section 355(e), no gain or loss will be recognized by, and no amount will be includible in the income of, Journal as a result of the distribution, other than with respect to any “excess loss account” or “intercompany transaction” required to be taken into account under Treasury regulations relating to consolidated returns;  

|   
---|---  
•| no gain or loss will be recognized by, or be includible in the income of, a holder of Journal common stock, solely as a result of the receipt of Journal Spinco common stock;  

|   
---|---  
•| the aggregate tax basis of the Journal common stock and Journal Spinco common stock in the hands of Journal’s shareholders immediately after the spin-off will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Journal common stock held by the holder immediately before the spin-off, allocated between the common stock of Journal and Journal Spinco common stock in proportion to their relative fair market values on the date of the spin-off; and   

|   
---|---  
•| the holding period of shares of the Journal Spinco common stock received by Journal’s shareholders will include the holding period of their shares of Journal common stock, provided that such shares are held as capital assets on the date of the spin-off.   

Journal shareholders that have acquired different blocks of shares of Journal common stock at different times or at different prices should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of their aggregate adjusted basis among, and their holding period of, Journal Spinco common stock distributed with respect to such blocks of Journal common stock.

U.S. Treasury Regulations require certain shareholders that receive stock in a spin-off to attach to their respective U.S. federal income tax returns, for the year in which the spin-off occurs, a detailed statement setting forth certain information relating to the spin-off. Within a reasonable period of time after the distribution, Journal expects to make available to its shareholders information pertaining to compliance with this requirement.

If the spin-off were not to qualify as a tax-free spin-off for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each Journal shareholder that receives shares of Journal Spinco common stock in the spin-off would be treated as receiving a distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares, and the distribution of shares of Journal Spinco common stock received with respect to a share of Journal common stock generally would be treated in the following manner:

|   
---|---  
•| first as a taxable dividend to the extent of the pro rata share of Journal’s current and accumulated earnings and profits that is allocable to the share of Journal common stock;  

|   
---|---  
•| then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholder’s tax basis in the share of Journal common stock; and  

|   
---|---  
•| thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value.  

Additionally, each shareholder’s basis in the Journal Spinco common stock would be equal to the fair market value of such stock on the date of the distribution, and such shareholder’s holding period in the Journal Spinco common stock would begin on the date of the distribution. Furthermore, Journal would recognize a taxable gain if the fair market value of Journal Spinco common stock exceeds Journal’s tax basis in such stock.

In connection with the spin-off, Journal Spinco, Journal Media Group and Journal have entered into a tax matters agreement whereby Journal Spinco, Journal Media Group and Journal have agreed to be subject to certain restrictions to preserve the tax-free nature of the spin-off. For a description of the tax matters agreements, see “Additional Agreements - Tax Matters Agreements” at page 140.

Journal Newspaper Merger

In connection with the transactions, Journal expects to receive an opinion from the law firm of Foley & Lardner LLP that the Journal newspaper merger will meet the requirements necessary for the merger to receive tax-free treatment under Sections 351 and/or 368 and related provisions of the Code. The opinion will be based on, among other things, current tax law and assumptions and representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants made by Journal Spinco, Journal Media Group and Journal, which if incorrect in certain material respects, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by Foley & Lardner LLP in its opinion. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants are incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or are violated in any material respect. The opinion of counsel will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. The opinion of counsel does not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the merger.

Journal and Journal Spinco have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matters relating to the merger, and as a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to the conclusions set forth below. In that event, the consequences described below would not apply and holders of Journal Spinco common stock who receive shares of Journal Media Group common stock in the merger could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.

Assuming the merger satisfies the requirements necessary for the merger to qualify for tax-free treatment under Sections 351 and/or 368 and related provisions of the Code, the following will describe the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to Journal Spinco and Journal Spinco’s shareholders of the merger:

|   
---|---  
•| no gain or loss will be recognized by, and no amount will be includible in the income of, Journal Spinco or Journal Media Group as a result of the merger;  

|   
---|---  
•| no gain or loss will be recognized by, or be includible in the income of, a holder of Journal Spinco common stock, solely as a result of the receipt of Journal Media Group common stock, except with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional shares;  

|   
---|---  
•| the aggregate tax basis of the Journal Media Group common stock received in the merger (including any fractional shares deemed received and sold for cash as described below) by a holder will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Journal Spinco common stock held by the holder immediately before the merger;   

|   
---|---  
•| the holding period of shares of the Journal Media Group common stock received by Journal Spinco’s stockholders will include the holding period of their shares of Journal Spinco common stock, provided that such shares are held as capital assets on the date of the merger;  

|   
---|---  
•| a Journal Spinco shareholder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional share of Journal Media Group common stock in the merger will be treated as having sold such fractional share for the amount of cash received and generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of such cash received and such shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the fractional share. That gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shareholder’s holding period for its Journal Spinco common stock exceeds one year.  

Payments of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Journal Media Group common stock may, under certain circumstances, be subject to “backup withholding,” unless a U.S. Holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or a correct taxpayer identification number, and otherwise complies with the requirements of the backup withholding rules. Corporations will generally be exempt from backup withholding, but may be required to provide a certification to establish their entitlement to the exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and it may be refunded or credited against a U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability if the required information is timely supplied to the IRS.

Journal Spinco’s shareholders that have different tax bases or holding periods for different blocks of Journal Spinco common stock should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of their aggregate adjusted basis among, and their holding period of, Journal Media Group common stock received with respect to such blocks of Journal Spinco common stock.

If the merger were not to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each Journal Spinco shareholder that receives shares of Journal Media Group common stock in the merger would be treated as recognizing taxable gain to the extent the fair market value of such shares exceeds such shareholder’s tax basis in its Journal Spinco common stock. Additionally, each shareholder’s basis in the Journal Media Group common stock would be equal to the fair market value of such stock on the date of the merger, and such shareholder’s holding period in the Journal Media Group common stock would begin on the date of the merger.

Broadcast Merger

In connection with the transactions, Scripps expects to receive an opinion from the law firm of Baker & Hostetler LLP and Journal expects to receive an opinion from the law firm of Foley & Lardner LLP that the broadcast merger will meet the requirements necessary for such merger to receive tax-free treatment under Section 368 and related provisions of the Code. The opinions will be based on, among other things, current tax law and assumptions and representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants made by Journal, which if incorrect in certain material respects, would jeopardize the conclusions reached by Baker & Hostetler LLP and Foley & Lardner LLP in their opinions. The opinions cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants are incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or are violated in any material respect. The opinions of counsel will not be binding on the IRS or the courts. The opinions of counsel do not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the merger.

Journal and Scripps have not sought and will not seek any ruling from the IRS regarding any matters relating to the merger, and as a result, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position contrary to the conclusions set forth below. In that event, the consequences described below would not apply and holders of Journal common stock who receive Scripps common shares in the merger could be subject to significant U.S. federal income tax liability.

Assuming the merger satisfies the requirements necessary for the merger to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 368 and related provisions of the Code, the following will describe the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to Journal and Scripps and to Journal’s shareholders of the merger:

|   
---|---  
•| no gain or loss will be recognized by, and no amount will be includible in the income of, Journal or Scripps as a result of the merger;  

|   
---|---  
•| no gain or loss will be recognized by, or be includible in the income of, a holder of Journal common stock, solely as a result of the receipt of Scripps common shares, except with respect to any cash received in lieu of fractional shares;  

|   
---|---  
•| the aggregate tax basis of the Scripps common stock received in the merger (including any fractional shares deemed received and sold for cash as described below) by a holder will be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the Journal common stock held by the holder immediately before the merger;   

|   
---|---  
•| the holding period of Scripps common shares received by Journal’s shareholders will include the holding period of their shares of Journal common stock, provided that such shares are held as capital assets on the date of the merger; and  

|   
---|---  
•| a Journal shareholder who receives cash in lieu of a fractional Scripps common share in the merger will be treated as having sold such fractional share for the amount of cash received and generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of such cash received and such shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in the fractional share. That gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shareholder’s holding period for its Journal common stock exceeds one year.  

Payments of cash in lieu of a fractional Scripps common share may, under certain circumstances, be subject to “backup withholding,” unless a U.S. Holder provides proof of an applicable exemption or a correct taxpayer identification number, and otherwise complies with the requirements of the backup withholding rules. Corporations will generally be exempt from backup withholding, but may be required to provide a certification to establish their entitlement to the exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax, and it may be refunded or credited against a U.S. Holder's U.S. federal income tax liability if the required information is timely supplied to the IRS.

A holder of Journal class B common stock who receives cash in connection with the exercise of dissenters’ rights will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of such cash received and such shareholder’s adjusted tax basis in its class B common stock. That gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the shareholder’s holding period for its Journal class B common stock exceeds one year.

Journal’s shareholders that have different tax bases or holding periods for different blocks of Journal common stock should consult their tax advisors regarding the allocation of their aggregate adjusted basis among, and their holding period of, Scripps common shares received with respect to such blocks of Journal common stock.

If the merger were not to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each Journal shareholder that receives Scripps common shares in the merger would be treated as recognizing taxable gain to the extent the fair market value of such 

123

<a name="s23129B9C4500F082D69450CFB37D1D29"></a>

shares exceeds such shareholder’s tax basis in its Journal common stock. Additionally, each shareholder’s basis in the Scripps common shares would be equal to the fair market value of such shares on the date of the merger, and such shareholder’s holding period in the Scripps common shares would begin on the date of the merger. Furthermore, Journal would recognize a taxable gain to the extent the fair market value of Scripps common shares exceeds Journal’s tax basis in its properties.

Neither Journal nor Scripps currently intends to waive the condition that it receive a favorable tax opinion as described above. If either Journal or Scripps waives any such condition, Journal and Scripps will revise and recirculate this joint proxy statement/prospectus and resolicit the votes of Journal and Scripps shareholders.

Scripps’ and Journal’s shareholders should consult their own tax advisors as to the specific tax consequences of the transactions to them, including the application and effect of state, local or non-U.S. tax laws and of changes in applicable tax laws.

Titles: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

<a name="s0FE8EF35C3072448CE5750CFA3D23FDB"></a>

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE SPECIAL MEETINGS

The following are brief answers to common questions that you may have regarding the Master Transaction Agreement, which we refer to as the “master agreement” and which is attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex A, the proposed transactions, the special meetings and the consideration to be received in the proposed transactions. The questions and answers in this section may not address all questions that may be important to you as a shareholder of Scripps or Journal. To better understand these matters, and for a description of the legal terms governing the proposed transactions, we urge you to read carefully and in its entirety this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including the annexes to, and the documents incorporated by reference in, this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See “Where You Can Find More Information” beginning on page 207.

Q: What are the proposed transactions?

A: Scripps and Journal and certain of their subsidiaries entered into the master agreement on July 30, 2014. The master agreement provides for the combination of the newspaper businesses of Scripps and Journal and the combination of the broadcast businesses of Scripps and Journal by means of a multi-step spin-off and merger process. As a result of the transactions contemplated by the master agreement, the newspaper businesses of the two companies will be owned and operated by a new holding company, which we refer to as “Journal Media Group,” shares of which we expect to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and initially owned by the shareholders of Scripps and Journal. As a further result of the transactions contemplated by the master agreement, following execution of the steps necessary for the combination of the newspaper businesses of Scripps and Journal, Scripps will combine the broadcast business of Journal by merging Journal into a wholly owned subsidiary of Scripps and issuing class A common shares of Scripps to Journal shareholders in exchange for their shares in Journal. We sometimes refer to the spin-offs and mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the master agreement, taken as a whole, as the “transactions”; to the spin-offs of the Scripps and Journal newspaper businesses, as the “Scripps newspaper spin-off”, “Journal newspaper spin-off”, or together the “newspaper spin-offs”; to the steps constituting the combination of the newspaper businesses of Scripps and Journal, as the “Scripps newspaper merger”, the “Journal newspaper merger”, or together the “newspaper mergers”; and to the combination of the broadcast businesses of Scripps and Journal, as the “broadcast merger.” 

Q: Why am I receiving this document?

A: In order to complete the transactions, the shareholders of Journal must approve (1) the spin-off of its newspaper business, and subsequent combination thereof with the Scripps newspaper business and (2) the subsequent merger of Journal into a wholly owned subsidiary of Scripps, and the holders of common voting shares of Scripps must approve (i) an amendment to Scripps’ articles of incorporation to facilitate the spin-off of its newspaper business with one class of common stock and (ii) the issuance of class A common shares of Scripps pursuant to the broadcast merger. Journal is also seeking the approval of its shareholders, on an advisory basis, of the compensation that may be paid or become payable to its named executive officers in connection with the transactions, but such approval is not required to complete the transactions. Scripps and Journal will hold separate special shareholders’ meetings to obtain these approvals. We are sending you these materials to help you decide how to vote your shares with respect to the matters to be considered at the special meetings. This joint proxy statement/prospectus contains important information about the transactions, including the special meetings of the shareholders of Scripps and Journal. You should read it carefully and in its entirety. The enclosed proxy cards allow you to authorize the voting of your shares without attending your company’s special meeting.

Your vote is important regardless of how many shares you own. We encourage you to submit a proxy as soon as possible. 

Q: What will Scripps shareholders receive in the transactions?

A: Prior to the completion of the transactions, Scripps will contribute its newspaper business to Scripps Spinco and Scripps will spin-off Scripps Spinco to its shareholders, whereby Scripps shareholders will be credited with one share of common stock of Scripps Spinco for each share of Scripps common stock held by them. The shares of Scripps Spinco will not be distributed to Scripps shareholders, but will be held by the exchange agent for the benefit of Scripps shareholders until those shares are exchanged for shares of common stock of Journal Media Group in connection with the newspaper mergers. As a result of the spin-off of the Scripps newspaper business and the combination thereof with the Journal newspaper business, each Scripps class A common share will ultimately be converted into 0.2500 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group, and each Scripps common voting share will ultimately be converted into 0.2500 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group. Additionally, holders of Scripps class A common shares (and unvested restricted stock units) and common voting shares of Scripps will receive their pro rata share of an aggregate $60.0 million dividend, which we refer to as the “Scripps special dividend,” payable 

i

<a name="s0FE8EF35C3072448CE5750CFA3D23FDB"></a>

immediately prior to the completion of the broadcast merger. Scripps shareholders will not receive any shares in connection with the broadcast merger, but will retain their existing shares in Scripps. 

Q: What will Journal shareholders receive in the transactions?

A: Prior to the completion of the transactions, Journal will contribute its newspaper business to Journal Spinco and Journal will spin-off Journal Spinco to its shareholders, whereby Journal shareholders will be credited with one share of common stock of Journal Spinco for each share of Journal common stock held by them. The shares of Journal Spinco will not be distributed to Journal shareholders, but will be held by the exchange agent for the benefit of Journal shareholders until those shares are exchanged for shares of Journal Media Group common stock in connection with the newspaper mergers. As a result of the spin-off of the Journal newspaper business and the combination thereof with the Scripps newspaper business, each share of Journal class A common stock and each share of Journal class B common stock will ultimately be converted into 0.1950 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group. As a result of the broadcast merger, each share of Journal class A common stock and each share of Journal class B common stock will ultimately be converted into 0.5176 class A common shares of Scripps. The Scripps special dividend will not be paid on Scripps class A common shares issued to Journal shareholders in the broadcast merger. Thus, Journal shareholders will receive 0.1950 shares of Journal Media Group and 0.5176 class A common shares of Scripps for each share of Journal common stock held on the share exchange record date. 

Q: How were the exchange ratios determined? 

A: The exchange ratios for the newspaper mergers and the broadcast merger resulted from negotiations between Scripps and its advisors, on the one hand, and Journal and its advisors, on the other hand. Each of Scripps and Journal evaluated its own businesses and the other's businesses based on information in its possession or provided by the other party. Scripps and Journal considered, among other factors, their respective views of the relative values of each company's newspaper and broadcast businesses and the potential synergies that could reasonably be expected from the combinations, the opportunity to pay a tax-efficient dividend to Scripps shareholders, the optimum number of shares of Journal Media Group to have outstanding for purposes of trading liquidity, and the potential trading range of the stocks of Scripps and Journal Media Group following completion of the transactions. There was no single definitive analysis used to determine the exchange ratios in the negotiations. Rather, the entirety of the work performed by Scripps and Journal with the assistance of their respective advisors in analyzing financial and other information informed the positions of each party in negotiating and arriving at the final exchange ratios.

Q: Why is Scripps paying a $60 million dividend to its shareholders? 

A: During the negotiation of the exchange ratios, Scripps and Journal agreed that Scripps would pay a $60 million dividend to its shareholders prior to completion of the broadcast merger and the Journal shareholders would receive as a result of the broadcast merger ownership of approximately 31% of the equity of Scripps following completion of the transactions. The leverage and capital structure of Scripps following the transactions, the relative ownership of Scripps by the Scripps shareholders and the Journal shareholders following the transactions, and the economic value of a tax-efficient dividend to the Scripps shareholders were the factors considered by the parties in determining the dividend. 

Q: When do you expect the transactions to be completed?

A: As of the date of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2015. The closing of the transactions is subject to various conditions, including the approval of the Scripps amendment proposal (defined below) and the Scripps share issuance proposal (defined below) by the holders of common voting shares of Scripps, and the approval of the Journal spin-off proposal (defined below) and the Journal merger proposal (defined below) by the Journal shareholders, as well as necessary regulatory consents and approvals. No assurance can be provided as to when or if the transactions will be completed, and it is possible that factors outside the control of Scripps and Journal could result in the transactions being completed at a later time, or not at all. See “The Master Transaction Agreement - Other Covenants and Agreements - Efforts to Consummate the Transactions” beginning on page 137 and “The Master Transaction Agreement - Conditions to the Transactions” beginning on page 135.

Q: When and where will the special meetings be held?

A: The Scripps special meeting will be held at the Scripps Center, 10th floor conference center, Cincinnati, 312 Walnut Street, Ohio 45202, at 10:00 a.m., Eastern Time, on March 11, 2015. 

The Journal special meeting will be held at 333 West State Street, second floor, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53203, at 9:00 a.m., Central Time, on March 11, 2015. 

Q: What are the proposals on which holders of common voting shares of Scripps are being asked to vote and what is the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Scripps with respect to each proposal?

A: At the Scripps special meeting, the holders of Scripps common voting shares are being asked to:

|   
---|---  
1.| Consider and vote on a proposal to amend the articles of incorporation of Scripps to allow Scripps to effect the spin-off of its newspaper business through the issuance of the same class of common shares of the entity that will own such business (which we refer to as “Scripps Spinco”) to each holder of class A common shares and each holder of common voting shares of Scripps, which we refer to as the “Scripps amendment proposal.” The proposed amendment to Scripps’ articles of incorporation is shown in Annex B attached hereto.   

|   
---|---  
2.| Consider and vote on a proposal to approve the issuance of class A common shares of Scripps pursuant to the broadcast merger, which we refer to as the “Scripps share issuance proposal.”  

The Board of Directors of Scripps unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” each of the proposals referred to above. 

Scripps will transact no other business at the special meeting other than any such business that may be properly brought before the special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 

Q: Why is it necessary to amend the articles of incorporation of Scripps? 

A: In order to obtain the consent of the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, to our acquisition of the broadcast business of Journal, the Scripps family, which, through the Scripps Family Agreement, controls us now and will continue to control Scripps following completion of the transactions, will not be permitted to control Journal Media Group. As currently constituted, our articles of incorporation only permit us to spin-off a business with a capital structure that enables the Scripps family to control the business to be spun-off. Approval of the proposed amendment to our articles, which must be approved by the Scripps family as holders of our outstanding common voting shares, will allow us to spin-off our newspaper business without perpetuating control of that business or Journal Media Group by the Scripps family. The amendment to our articles, coupled with the amendment that the Scripps family has made to the Scripps Family Agreement to exclude the Journal Media Group shares from that Agreement, facilitated our receiving the FCC consent and being able to complete the transactions. See “Scripps Proposals to be Voted on at the Special Meeting” beginning on page 53 and “Scripps Family Agreement” beginning on page 197. 

Q: Do Scripps shareholders have to vote to approve the Scripps newspaper spin-off or the Scripps newspaper merger?

A: No. No vote of Scripps shareholders, with respect to either the shares of Scripps or the shares of Scripps Spinco, is required or being sought in connection with the Scripps newspaper spin-off or the Scripps newspaper merger. Scripps Media, as the sole shareholder of Scripps Spinco, has approved the transactions contemplated by the master agreement, including the Scripps newspaper merger.

Q: What vote is required to approve the proposals being presented at the special meeting of Scripps shareholders?

A: Assuming a quorum is present, to be approved at the special meeting, the Scripps amendment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all common voting shares of Scripps outstanding on the record date for the special meeting, and the Scripps share issuance proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all votes cast at the special meeting by holders of common voting shares of Scripps.

Q: Will the Scripps shareholders holding common voting shares of Scripps be asked to vote on the Scripps share issuance proposal and the Scripps amendment proposal at the special meeting if the Board of Directors has changed its recommendations for such proposals?

A: Yes, if Journal so requests. The Scripps board may change its recommendation with respect to these proposals only if it decides that a third party acquisition proposal for control of Scripps is superior to the transactions. 

Q: What are the proposals on which the Journal shareholders are being asked to vote and what is the recommendation of the Board of Directors of Journal with respect to each proposal? 

A: At the Journal special meeting, Journal shareholders are being asked to vote on the following matters:

|   
---|---  
1.| A proposal to approve the spin-off of the Journal newspaper business and the subsequent merger of the entity that will hold such newspaper business (which we refer to as “Journal Spinco”) with a wholly owned subsidiary of Journal Media Group, which we refer to as the “Journal spin-off proposal;”  

|   
---|---  
2.| A proposal to approve the broadcast merger, which we refer to as the “Journal merger proposal;”  

|   
---|---  
3.| A non-binding, advisory proposal to approve the compensation that may be paid or become payable to Journal’s named executive officers in connection with the transactions, as disclosed in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, which we refer to as the “Journal compensation proposal;” and   

|   
---|---  
4.| A proposal to approve the adjournment or postponement of the Journal special meeting, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies in the event there are not sufficient votes at the time of the Journal special meeting to approve both the Journal spin-off proposal and the Journal merger proposal, which we refer to as the “Journal adjournment proposal.”  

The Board of Directors of Journal unanimously recommends a vote “FOR” each of the proposals referred to above.

Journal will transact no other business at the special meeting other than any such business that may be properly brought before the Journal special meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof. 

Q: Why is it necessary for Journal shareholders to approve the Journal spin-off proposal and the Journal merger proposal?

A: Journal's amended and restated articles of incorporation require Journal to first obtain the approval of shareholders holding at least sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66 2/3%) of the voting power of the outstanding shares of Journal class A common stock and Journal class B common stock prior to the consummation of certain "strategic transactions." Each of the Journal spin-off proposal and the Journal merger proposal constitutes a "strategic transaction" under Journal's amended and restated articles of incorporation, and, therefore, Journal is seeking Journal shareholder approval with respect to each proposal. "See Journal Proposals to be Voted on at the Special Meeting" beginning on page 57.

Q: What vote is required to approve the proposals being presented at the special meeting of Journal shareholders?

A: Assuming a quorum is present, to be approved at the Journal special meeting, the Journal spin-off proposal and the Journal merger proposal each requires the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the voting power of all outstanding shares of Journal class A common stock and Journal class B common stock entitled to vote at the special meeting, voting together as a single class. If you mark “abstain” or fail to vote with respect to the Journal spin-off proposal and/or the Journal merger proposal, it will have the same effect as a vote “AGAINST” such proposals. 

Assuming a quorum is present, the approval of the Journal compensation proposal requires that the number of votes cast for the Journal compensation proposal exceed the number of votes cast against it. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present in determining whether there is a quorum; however they will not constitute a vote for or against the non-binding proposal and will be disregarded in the calculation of votes cast.

Whether or not a quorum is present, the Journal adjournment proposal requires that the number of votes cast for the Journal adjournment proposal exceed the number of votes cast against it. Abstentions and broker non-votes will be counted as present in determining whether there is a quorum; however they will not constitute a vote for or against the proposal and will be disregarded in the calculation of votes cast.

Q: Will the Journal shareholders be asked to vote on the Journal spin-off proposal and the Journal merger proposal at the special meeting if the Board of Directors has changed its recommendations for such proposals?

A: Yes, if Scripps so requests. The Journal board may change its recommendation with respect to these proposals only if it decides that a third party acquisition proposal for control of Journal is superior to the transactions. 

Q: What is the effect if these proposals are not approved at the special meetings?

A: If the Scripps amendment proposal or the Scripps share issuance proposal is not approved by the requisite vote at the special meeting of Scripps shareholders, or if the Journal spin-off proposal or the Journal merger proposal is not approved by the requisite vote at the special meeting of Journal shareholders, then the transactions will not occur.

Q: Who is entitled to vote at the special meetings?

A: The Board of Directors of Journal has fixed January 6, 2015, as the record date for its special meeting and the Board of Directors of Scripps has fixed February 3, 2015, as the record date for its special meeting. If you were a holder of common voting shares of Scripps or a holder of shares of class A or class B common stock of Journal at the close of business on the respective record date, you are entitled to receive notice of, and vote at, your company’s special meeting. 

Q: If I am a Scripps shareholder, how many votes do I have?

A: If you are a Scripps shareholder, on each of the proposals that will be voted upon at the Scripps special meeting, you will be entitled to one vote per share of Scripps common voting shares that you owned as of the record date. As of the close of business on February 3, 2015, there were 11,932,722 common voting shares outstanding and entitled to vote. As of that date, all outstanding common voting shares were held by, or for the benefit of, descendants of the founder of Scripps. 

If you are a holder of class A common shares of Scripps, you will not be entitled to vote on either of the proposals being presented at the Scripps special meeting, but you may attend the meeting. 

Q: If I am a Journal shareholder, how many votes do I have?

A: If you are a holder of Journal class A common stock, on each of the proposals that will be voted upon at the Journal special meeting, you will be entitled to one vote per share of Journal class A common stock that you owned as of the record date. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 45,306,761 shares of Journal class A common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. These shares represented 45,306,761 votes as of the record date. 

If you are a holder of Journal class B common stock, on each of the proposals that will be voted upon at the Journal special meeting, you will be entitled to ten votes for each share of Journal class B common stock that you owned as of the record date. As of the close of business on the record date, there were 5,593,949.282 shares of Journal class B common stock outstanding and entitled to vote. These shares represented 55,939,492 votes as of the record date.

Holders of Journal class A common stock and class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters at the Journal special meeting.

Q: Are any Scripps shareholders already committed to vote in favor of the Scripps amendment proposal or the Scripps share issuance proposal? 

A: Certain directors of Scripps, all of whom are members of the Scripps family, have informed us that they currently intend to vote all of their common voting shares in favor of the Scripps amendment proposal and the Scripps share issuance proposal. As of January 27, 2015, these directors beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 1,593,026 common voting shares, representing approximately 13.35% of the outstanding common voting shares. Other than the foregoing directors, no members of the Scripps family, including those who are party to the Scripps Family Agreement, have committed to vote in favor of either of the proposals to be voted on at our special meeting of shareholders. See “Summary - Voting by Scripps’ Directors and Executive Officers” beginning on page 11.

Q: Are any Journal shareholders already committed to vote in favor of the Journal spin-off proposal or the Journal merger proposal?

A: The directors and executive officers of Journal have informed Journal that they currently intend to vote all of their Journal class A common stock and Journal class B common stock in favor of the Journal spin-off proposal and the Journal merger proposal. As of January 6, 2015, these persons beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 33,635 shares (or approximately 0.07%) of the Journal class A common stock and 2,607,061 shares (or approximately 46.6%) of the Journal class B common stock, representing collectively approximately 25.8% of the voting power of the Journal shareholders. See “Summary - Voting by Journal’s Directors and Executive Officers” beginning on page 11. 

Q: What constitutes a quorum for each special meeting?

A: Holders of a majority of the outstanding Scripps common voting shares, represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the Scripps special meeting.

Holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding Journal class A common stock and Journal class B common stock, taken together, in each case represented in person or by proxy, will constitute a quorum for the Journal special meeting.

Q: Who can attend each special meeting?

A: If you held Scripps class A common shares or common voting shares, or Journal class A common stock or class B common stock, as of the record date, you may attend your company’s special meeting. If you are a beneficial owner of stock held in “street name,” you must provide evidence of your ownership of such stock, which you can obtain from your broker, bank or other nominee, in order to attend your company’s special meeting.

Q: What if my bank, broker or other nominee holds my shares in “street name”?

A: If a bank, broker or other nominee holds your shares for your benefit but not in your own name, such shares are in “street name.” In that case, your bank, broker or other nominee will send you a voting instruction form to use in order to instruct the vote of your shares. The availability of telephone and internet voting instruction depends on the voting procedures of your bank, broker or other nominee. Please follow the instructions on the voting instruction form they send you. If your shares are held in the name of your bank, broker or other nominee and you wish to attend or vote in person at your company’s special meeting, you must contact your bank, broker or other nominee and request a document called a “legal proxy.” You must bring this legal proxy to the special meeting in order to vote in person. Your bank, broker or other nominee will not vote your shares unless you provide instructions on how to vote.

Q: If I am a Scripps shareholder holding common voting shares, how do I vote? 

A: After reading and carefully considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please submit a proxy or voting instructions for your Scripps common voting shares as promptly as possible so that your shares will be represented at the Scripps special meeting. If you are a holder of record of Scripps common voting shares as of the close of business on the record date, you may submit your proxy before the Scripps special meeting by marking, signing and dating your proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope we have provided. 

In lieu of submitting a proxy, holders of common voting shares may vote in person at the Scripps special meeting. For additional information on voting procedures, see “The Scripps Special Meeting - How to Vote” beginning on page 51.

After reading and carefully considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please submit your proxy or voting instructions as soon as possible, whether or not you plan to attend the Scripps special meeting.

Q: Do the holders of Scripps class A common shares have the right to vote on the proposals? 

A: No. The holders of Scripps class A common shares are receiving this joint proxy statement/prospectus for informational purposes only and are not entitled to vote their class A common shares of Scripps on any proposals being submitted at the Scripps special meeting.

Q: If I am a Journal shareholder, how do I vote?

A: After reading and carefully considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please submit a proxy for your shares as promptly as possible so that your shares will be represented at the Journal special meeting. If you are a shareholder of record of Journal as of the close of business on the record date, you may submit your proxy before the Journal special meeting by marking, signing and dating your proxy card and returning it in the postage-paid envelope we have provided.

In addition, holders of record of class A common stock and class B common stock may vote in person at the Journal special meeting or by mail or through the internet. For additional information on voting procedures, see “The Journal Special Meeting - How to Vote” beginning on page 55.

After reading and carefully considering the information contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, please submit your proxy as soon as possible whether or not you plan to attend the Journal special meeting.

Q: What do I do if I receive more than one set of voting materials? 

A: You may receive more than one set of voting materials, including multiple copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus and multiple proxy cards or voting instruction cards. For example, if you hold your shares in more than one brokerage account, you will receive a separate instruction card for each brokerage account in which you hold shares. If you are a holder of record and your shares are held in more than one name, you will receive more than one proxy card. You may also receive multiple copies of this joint proxy statement/prospectus if you are a shareholder of both Scripps and Journal. Please complete, sign, date and return each proxy card and voting instruction card you receive, or, if you are a shareholder of Journal, you may submit a proxy by telephone or internet by following the instructions on each proxy card.

Q: How will my proxy be voted?

A: If you submit a proxy or voting instructions by completing, signing, dating and mailing your proxy card or voting instruction card, or, if you are a Journal shareholder, by submitting your proxy by internet or by telephone, your shares will be voted in accordance with your instructions. If you are a shareholder of record as of the record date and you sign, date, and return your proxy card but do not indicate how you want to vote on any particular proposal and do not indicate that you wish to abstain with respect to that proposal, Scripps common voting shares represented by your proxy will be voted as recommended by the Scripps Board of Directors with respect to that proposal, and the Journal class A common stock or class B common stock represented by your proxy will be voted as recommended by the Journal Board of Directors with respect to that proposal.

Q: What if I mark “abstain” when voting, or do not vote on the proposals?

A: If you fail to vote in person or by proxy any shares for which you are the record owner as of the record date or fail to instruct your broker or other nominee on how to vote the shares you hold in street name, your shares will not be counted in determining whether a quorum is present at your company’s special meeting. If you mark abstain when voting, your shares will be counted in determining whether a quorum is present at your company’s special meeting.

If you are a Scripps shareholder, because the Scripps amendment proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of all outstanding Scripps common voting shares, failing to vote or abstaining from voting on such proposal will have the effect of a vote “AGAINST” such proposal. Failing to vote or abstaining from voting on the Scripps share issuance proposal will not constitute a vote for or against such proposal and will be disregarded in the calculation of the votes cast. 

If you are a holder of Journal class A common stock or Journal class B common stock, because the Journal spin-off and merger proposals require the affirmative vote of the holders of two-thirds of the voting power of all outstanding Journal class A common stock and Journal class B common stock, voting together as a single class, your failure to vote or abstain with respect to either Journal proposal will have the effect of a vote “AGAINST” such proposal. Failing to vote or abstaining from voting on the Journal compensation proposal or the Journal adjournment proposal will not constitute a vote for or against such proposals and will be disregarded in the calculation of the votes cast.

Q: Can I change my vote after I have submitted a proxy or voting instruction card? 

A: Yes. If you are a shareholder of record as of your company's applicable record date, you can change your proxy at any time before it is voted at your company’s special meeting. You can do this in one of three ways:

|   
---|---  
•| you can send a signed notice of revocation to the Secretary of Scripps or Journal, as appropriate;  

|   
---|---  
•| you can submit a revised proxy bearing a later date by mail, or, if you are a Journal shareholder, by internet or telephone; or  

|   
---|---  
•| you can attend your company’s special meeting and vote in person, which will automatically cancel any proxy previously given, though your attendance alone will not revoke any proxy that you have previously given.  

Q: If I am a Scripps shareholder, will I be required to exchange my shares in connection with the newspaper spin-offs, newspaper mergers or the broadcast merger? 

A: No. You will not be required to exchange your certificates or “book-entry” securities representing common shares of Scripps. Upon completion of the broadcast merger, certificates and “book-entry” securities representing common shares of Scripps prior to the transactions will represent an equal number of common shares of Scripps following such merger. Upon completion of the newspaper spin-offs and the newspaper mergers, you will receive “book-entry” securities representing shares of Journal Media Group common stock. 

Q: If I am a Journal shareholder, will I be required to exchange my shares in connection with the newspaper spin-offs, newspaper mergers or the broadcast merger?

A: You will not be required to exchange your certificates or book-entry securities representing shares of common stock of Journal in connection with the newspaper spin-offs or the newspaper mergers. Upon completion of those transactions, you will receive book-entry securities representing your shares of Journal Media Group common stock. Similarly, you will not be required to exchange your book-entry securities representing shares of common stock of Journal in connection with the broadcast merger. Upon completion of the broadcast merger, your Journal book-entry shares will be converted into book-entry Scripps class A common shares. However, if you have certificates representing shares of Journal class A common stock, then you will be required to exchange such certificates in connection with the broadcast merger. Following completion of the broadcast merger, the exchange agent will send you a letter of transmittal to be used to exchange your certificated shares of Journal class A common stock for book-entry Scripps class A common shares.

Q: If I am a Journal shareholder and have class A stock certificates, should I send in my certificates now? 

A: No. If you hold certificates representing Journal class A common stock, the exchange agent will send you written instructions informing you how to exchange your shares in connection with the broadcast merger. 

Q: Are there any risks that I should consider?

A: Yes. There are risks associated with all spin-offs and business combinations, including the proposed transactions. There are also risks associated with the broadcast business of Scripps following the broadcast merger, the newspaper business of Journal Media Group, the ownership of class A common shares of Scripps following the broadcast merger and the ownership of common stock of Journal Media Group. We have described certain of these risks and other risks in more detail under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 32.

Q: What challenges will Journal Media Group face as a standalone company? 

A: The following are among the challenges that Journal Media Group will face as a standalone company following completion of the transactions: 

|   
---|---  
•|  integrating successfully the newspaper business of Journal and Scripps;   

|   
---|---  
•| arranging or developing key services and functions that Journal and Scripps historically have provided for Journal Media Group's newspapers;   

viii

* * *

<a name="s0FE8EF35C3072448CE5750CFA3D23FDB"></a>

|   
---|---  
•| addressing the secular decline in the print newspaper business without the capital resources and diversification of business risks previously afforded to Journal Media Group's newspapers by Scripps and Journal; and   

|   
---|---  
•| responding to changes in technology and to evolving industry standards and trends.   

Q: Are Scripps or Journal shareholders entitled to dissenters' rights?

A: Scripps shareholders are not entitled to dissenters' rights in connection with the transactions.

Holders of Journal class A common stock are not entitled to dissenters' rights in connection with the transactions. 

Holders of Journal class B common stock may assert dissenters’ rights in connection with the broadcast merger to the extent such rights are available under Wisconsin law with respect to their Journal class B common stock and, if such rights are properly exercised, such shareholders will be entitled to receive payment of the “fair value” of such shares in accordance with Wisconsin law instead of receiving the merger consideration payable in respect of such shares in the broadcast merger.

In order to preserve any dissenters’ rights that a Journal class B shareholder may have, in addition to otherwise complying with the applicable provisions of Wisconsin law, such shareholder must have given Journal notice of his, her or its intent to demand payment of the fair value of the shares if the transactions are consummated and must demand payment in writing after receiving from Journal a notice specifying the procedure for demanding payment. For additional information on dissenters’ rights, see “Dissenters’ Rights” beginning on page 199.

Q: What are the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transactions to holders of Scripps common shares and Journal common stock?

A: Subject to the limitations and qualifications described in “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transactions,” for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) no gain or loss will be recognized by, or be includible in the income of, a U.S. Holder of Scripps common shares as a result of the Scripps newspaper contribution, Scripps newspaper spin-off, Scripps newspaper merger, or broadcast merger, except with respect to any cash received by Scripps shareholders in lieu of fractional shares of Journal Media Group, and (ii) no gain or loss will be recognized by, or be includible in the income of, a U.S. Holder of Journal common stock as a result of the Journal newspaper contribution, Journal newspaper spin-off, Journal newspaper merger, or broadcast merger, except with respect to any cash received by (a) Journal shareholders in lieu of fractional shares of Journal Media Group or Scripps or (b) holders of Journal class B common stock in connection with the exercise of dissenters’ rights. The treatment of any cash received by a U.S. Holder of Scripps common shares or Journal common stock is discussed in “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transactions.” The cash received by a Scripps shareholder in the Scripps special dividend with respect to a Scripps common share generally will be treated in the following manner:

|   
---|---  
•| first as a taxable dividend to the extent of the pro rata share of Scripps’ current and accumulated earnings and profits that is allocable to the Scripps common share, if any (as of September 30, 2014, Scripps had no current or accumulated earnings and profits, and Scripps is expected not to have any current or accumulated earnings or profits for the taxable year in which the distribution is made);  

|   
---|---  
•| then as a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholder’s tax basis in the Scripps share; and  

|   
---|---  
•| thereafter as capital gain with respect to any remaining value.  

The obligation of Scripps to complete the transaction is conditioned upon the receipt by Scripps of an opinion from Baker & Hostetler LLP, counsel to Scripps, to the effect that for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) the SMI newspaper contribution and the SMI newspaper distribution will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”); (ii) the SMI newspaper distribution will qualify as a distribution described in Section 355 of the Code; (iii) with respect to the SMI newspaper distribution, the Scripps Spinco common stock will be treated as “qualified property” for purposes of Section 361(c)(2) of the Code; (iv) the Scripps newspaper contribution and the Scripps newspaper spin-off will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code; (v) the Scripps newspaper spin-off will qualify as a distribution described in Section 355 of the Code; (vi) with respect to the Scripps newspaper spin-off, the Scripps Spinco common stock will be treated as “qualified property” for purposes of Section 361(c)(2) of the Code; (vii) the exchange of Scripps Spinco common stock for Journal Media Group common stock pursuant to the Scripps newspaper merger will qualify as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code and/or a reorganization described in Sections 368(a)(1)(B) and/or 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code; and (viii) the broadcast merger will qualify as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code.

The obligation of Journal to complete the transactions is conditioned upon the receipt by Journal of an opinion from Foley & Lardner LLP, counsel to Journal, to the effect that for U.S. federal income tax purposes (i) the Journal newspaper contribution and the Journal newspaper spin-off will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the Code; (ii) the Journal newspaper spin-off will qualify as a distribution described in Section 355 of the Code; (iii) the exchange of Journal Spinco common stock for Journal Media Group common stock pursuant to the Journal newspaper merger will qualify as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code and/or a reorganization described in Sections 368(a)(1)(B) and/or 368(a)(2)(E) of the Code; and (iv) the broadcast merger will qualify as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code. As a result of the application of Section 355(e), at the corporate level Journal will recognize gain but not loss on the distribution of shares of Journal Spinco common stock to the extent the fair market value of such shares exceeds Journal’s tax basis in such shares. 

Neither Journal nor Scripps currently intends to waive the condition that it receive a favorable tax opinion as described above. If either Journal or Scripps waives any of such conditions, Journal and Scripps will revise and recirculate this joint proxy statement/prospectus and resolicit the votes of Journal and Scripps shareholders.

For a more detailed summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the mergers and for definitions of certain terms used above, see “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transactions” beginning on page 117.

Q: Who will serve as the exchange agent?

A: Computershare. As exchange agent, it will (i) credit to Scripps and Journal shareholders their shares in Journal Media Group in connection with the newspaper spin-offs and the newspaper mergers; (ii) credit to Journal shareholders who hold their shares in book-entry form their Scripps class A common shares to which they are entitled in connection with the broadcast merger; and (iii) credit to Journal shareholders who hold their shares of Journal class A common stock in certificated form Scripps class A common shares in book-entry form to which they are entitled in connection with the broadcast merger upon submission of properly completed letters of transmittal and certificates for Journal class A common stock. 

Q: Whom should I contact if I have any questions about voting? 

A: If you have any questions about the proxy materials or if you need assistance submitting your proxy or voting your shares or need additional copies of this document or the enclosed proxy card, the contacts are as follows:

To the shareholders of The E. W. Scripps Company and Journal Communications, Inc.:

On July 30, 2014, The E. W. Scripps Company (“Scripps”) and Journal Communications, Inc. (“Journal”), together with various of their respective subsidiaries, entered into a Master Transaction Agreement providing for (1) first the spin-offs and subsequent combination of their newspaper businesses and (2) then the combination of their broadcast businesses through the merger of Journal into a wholly owned subsidiary of Scripps. The spin-offs and mergers are expected to create two industry-focused companies positioned for success. Scripps, based in Cincinnati, will own and operate television and radio stations serving 27 markets and reaching 18 percent of U.S. television households, making it the fifth-largest independent TV group in the country. Journal Media Group, Inc. ("Journal Media Group"), a newly formed public newspaper publishing entity owning the former Scripps and Journal newspapers, will be headquartered in Milwaukee and operate in 14 markets in the U.S. Scripps class A common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "SSP". 

Upon completion of the transactions, each share of Journal class A and class B common stock outstanding on the share exchange record date will receive 0.5176 class A common shares of Scripps and 0.1950 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group; and each Scripps class A common share and common voting share outstanding on the share exchange record date will receive 0.2500 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group. Immediately following the completion of the transactions, holders of Journal’s common stock will own approximately 41% of the common shares of Journal Media Group and approximately 31% of the common shares of Scripps, in the form of Scripps class A common shares, with the remaining common shares of each entity owned by the Scripps shareholders. Prior to the completion of the transactions, Scripps will distribute a special cash dividend in the aggregate amount of $60.0 million to the holders of its common shares (and certain common share equivalents held by Scripps directors and employees). The transactions are intended to be tax-free at both the shareholder and corporate levels at each of Scripps and Journal, with the exceptions of the distribution of Journal Spinco to Journal shareholders, which will be taxable at the Journal corporate level, and the distribution of the $60.0 million dividend by Scripps, which may be taxable to the shareholders of Scripps. 

Each of Scripps and Journal will hold a special meeting of its shareholders to consider and vote on matters necessary to complete the transactions. Information about the special meetings, the proposals to be voted on at each company’s special meeting, the proposed transactions and other related matters is contained in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, which we urge you to read carefully and in its entirety, including the annexes and exhibits and the information incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. 

In particular, you should consider the matters discussed under “Risk Factors” beginning on page 32 of this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Your vote is very important, regardless of the number of shares you own. To ensure your representation at your company’s special meeting, please complete and submit your proxy in accordance with the instructions contained herein. 

The Board of Directors of Scripps has approved and adopted the Master Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and recommends that the holders of common voting shares of Scripps vote “FOR” the approval of each of the proposals to be voted on by them at the Scripps special meeting, as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The Board of Directors of Journal has approved and adopted the Master Transaction Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and recommends that the Journal shareholders vote “FOR” the approval of each of the proposals to be voted on by them at the Journal special meeting, as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Titles: Risks Related to the Transactions

<a name="sF436DC038AD17E137C1750CFA907A497"></a>

Risks Related to the Transactions 

The number of Scripps class A common shares that Journal shareholders will receive in the broadcast merger is based on a fixed exchange ratio and the number of shares of Journal Media Group that Scripps and Journal shareholders will receive pursuant to the transactions is also based on a fixed exchange ratio. Because the market price of Scripps class A common shares and shares of Journal class A common stock will fluctuate, Scripps and Journal shareholders cannot be certain of the value of the consideration that the Journal and Scripps shareholders will receive in the transactions. 

Upon completion of the transactions, each outstanding share of Journal common stock (other than certain excluded shares and shares with respect to which the holders thereof have properly dissented and have not withdrawn their demand or waived their rights to dissent) will be converted into the right to receive 0.5176 Scripps class A common shares and 0.1950 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group. Upon completion of the transactions, each outstanding Scripps class A common share and common voting share will receive 0.2500 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group. The exchange ratios for determining the number of shares of Journal Media Group common stock that Journal and Scripps shareholders will receive in the transactions are fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of Journal class A common stock or Scripps class A common shares. The exchange ratio for determining the number of Scripps class A common shares that Journal shareholders will receive in the broadcast merger is also fixed and will not be adjusted for changes in the market price of Scripps class A common shares. The market value of Scripps class A common shares that the Journal shareholders will be entitled to receive in the broadcast merger will depend on the market value of Scripps class A common shares immediately before that merger is completed and could vary significantly from the market value on the date of the announcement of the transactions (i.e., July 30, 2014), the date that this joint proxy statement/prospectus was mailed to shareholders of Journal or Scripps or the date of the Journal or Scripps special meeting. In addition, there is currently no market value for shares of Journal Media Group. The master agreement does not provide for any adjustment to share consideration based on fluctuations of the per share price of Journal class A common stock or Scripps class A common shares. Additionally, the market value of Scripps class A common shares and Journal Media Group’s common stock that may prevail any time following the completion of the transactions is unknown and will likely fluctuate over time.

Fluctuations in the share price of Scripps and/or Journal Media Group could result from changes in the business, operations or prospects of Scripps or Journal prior to the closing of the transactions or of Scripps or Journal Media Group following the closing of the transactions. Regulatory developments, general market and economic conditions and other factors both within and beyond the control of Scripps or Journal could also contribute to fluctuations in the share price of Scripps and Journal Media Group. The transactions may be completed a considerable amount of time after the date of the Scripps and Journal special meetings. As such, at the time of the special meetings, Scripps or Journal shareholders will not know the value of the consideration they will receive pursuant to the transactions. 

The transactions are subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied or completed on a timely basis, if at all. 

Completion of the transactions is subject to closing conditions that make the completion and timing of the transactions uncertain. The conditions include, among others, the obtaining of the requisite approvals by the shareholders of Scripps and Journal for the completion of the transactions, as described in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the expiration of the HSR waiting period, the grant of the FCC consent, the absence of any governmental order preventing the completion of the transactions, the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this joint proxy statement/prospectus is a part, the effectiveness of the registration statement registering the shares of Journal Media Group to be issued pursuant to the newspaper mergers, the listing of Journal Media Group shares on the NYSE and the receipt of third party consents under Journal’s major network affiliation agreements. See “The Master Transaction Agreement - Conditions to the Transactions” beginning on page 135.

32

* * *

Although Scripps and Journal have agreed in the master agreement to use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite approvals and consents, there can be no assurance that these approvals and consents will be obtained, and these approvals and consents may be obtained later than anticipated. In addition, Scripps’ and Journal’s obligations to obtain the requisite consents and approvals from regulatory authorities are subject to certain limitations, including that neither Scripps nor Journal is required to agree to take actions or to make divestitures that may be required by the regulatory authorities except actions or divestitures reasonably required to obtain the FCC consent or the HSR clearance. If permitted under applicable law, either of Scripps or Journal may waive a condition for its own benefit and consummate the transactions even though one or more of these conditions has not been satisfied. Any determination whether to waive any condition will be made by Scripps or Journal at the time of such waiver based on the facts and circumstances as they exist at that time. In the event that a condition to the master agreement is waived, Scripps or Journal, as applicable, currently intends to evaluate the materiality of any such waiver and its effect on Scripps shareholders or Journal shareholders, as applicable, in light of the facts and circumstances at the time to determine whether any re-solicitation of proxies is required in light of such waiver.

The master agreement contains provisions that restrict Journal’s ability to pursue alternatives to the transactions and, in specified circumstances, could require Journal to pay to Scripps a termination fee.

Under the master agreement, Journal is restricted, subject to certain exceptions, from soliciting, initiating, knowingly facilitating or negotiating, or furnishing non-public information with regard to, any inquiry, proposal or offer for an alternative business combination transaction from any person. Journal may terminate the master agreement and enter into an agreement with respect to a superior proposal only if specified conditions have been satisfied, including a determination by the Journal Board of Directors (after having received the advice of a nationally recognized financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that such proposal is more favorable from a financial point of view to the Journal shareholders than the transactions. A termination in this instance would result in Journal being required to pay Scripps a termination fee of approximately $15.8 million plus up to $7.5 million in expense reimbursement. To be a superior proposal, the third party proposal must be an offer to acquire all of Journal’s businesses. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Journal from considering or proposing an alternative business combination transaction with Journal, even if such third party were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than the value of the transactions.

To be a superior proposal, the third party proposal must be an offer to acquire all of Scripps’ businesses. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of Scripps from considering or proposing an alternative business combination transaction with Scripps.

Failure to complete the transactions may negatively impact the share price and the future business and financial results of each of Scripps and Journal. 

The master agreement provides that either Scripps or Journal may terminate the master agreement if the transactions are not consummated on or before September 30, 2015 (which may be automatically extended to December 31, 2015, in the event all closing conditions have been satisfied or waived or are then capable of being satisfied other than those closing conditions related to the FCC consent or termination or expiration of the HRS waiting period). In addition, the master agreement contains certain termination rights for both Journal and Scripps including, among others, by Journal, in the event the Journal Board of Directors determines to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a superior proposal. Upon termination of the master agreement under specific circumstances, Journal will be required to pay Scripps a termination fee of approximately $15.8 million plus up to $7.5 million in expense reimbursement. The master agreement also provides that Scripps will be required to pay Journal approximately $15.8 million plus up to $7.5 million in expense reimbursement if the master agreement is terminated under certain circumstances.

If the transactions are not completed on a timely basis, Scripps’ and Journal’s ongoing businesses may be adversely affected. If the transactions are not completed at all, Scripps and Journal will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:

33

* * *

|   
---|---  
•| being required to pay costs and expenses relating to the transactions, such as termination fees and costs and legal, and accounting fees, whether or not the transactions are completed; and  

|   
---|---  
•| loss of time and resources committed by each company’s management to matters relating to the transactions that could have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities.  

If the transactions are not completed, the price of Scripps class A common shares and the price of the Journal class A common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the transactions will be completed and that the related benefits will be realized, or to the extent there is a market perception that the transactions were not consummated due to an adverse change in the business of Scripps or Journal.

Uncertainties associated with the transactions may cause employees to leave Scripps or Journal and may otherwise affect the future business and operations of Scripps and Journal Media Group. 

Scripps’ and Journal Media Group’s success after the transactions will depend in part upon their ability to retain key employees of Scripps and Journal. Prior to and following the transactions, current and prospective employees of Scripps and Journal may experience uncertainty about their future roles and choose to pursue other opportunities, which could have an adverse effect on Scripps and Journal Media Group. If key employees depart, the integration of the broadcast business of Scripps and Journal may be more difficult and Scripps’ business following the transactions could be adversely affected. Additionally, the inability of Scripps or Journal to retain key newspaper employees could adversely affect the success of Journal Media Group following the transactions.

Results of operations and financial condition of Scripps and Journal Media Group following the transactions may differ materially from the pro forma information presented in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The pro forma financial information included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus is derived from the historical audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements of Scripps and Journal, audited and unaudited carve-out financial statements of Scripps newspapers and Journal newspapers, as well as from certain internal, unaudited financial statements. The preparation of this pro forma information is based upon available information and certain assumptions and estimates that Scripps and Journal believe are reasonable. However, this pro forma information may be materially different from what Scripps’ and/or Journal Media Group’s actual results of operations and financial condition would have been had the transactions occurred during the periods presented or from what Scripps’ and/or Journal Media Group’s results of operations and financial position will be after the completion of the proposed transactions. In particular, the assumptions used in preparing the pro forma financial information may not be realized, and other factors may affect Scripps’ and/or Journal Media Group’s financial condition and results of operations following the transactions.

The integration of the newspaper and broadcast businesses of Scripps and Journal following the transactions will present significant challenges that may reduce the anticipated potential synergies of the transactions.

Scripps and Journal Media Group will face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating the two companies’ organizations and operations in a timely and efficient manner to realize anticipated synergies. The integration of the Scripps and Journal newspaper and broadcast businesses will be complex and time-consuming due to the size and complexity of each organization. The principal challenges will include the following:

|   
---|---  
•| integrating Scripps’ and Journal’s existing businesses;   

|   
---|---  
•| integrating information systems and internal controls over accounting and financial reporting;  

|   
---|---  
•| retaining key employees;  

|   
---|---  
•| preserving significant business relationships;   

|   
---|---  
•| consolidating corporate and administrative functions; and   

|   
---|---  
•| conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures.  

The managements of Scripps and Journal Media Group will have to dedicate substantial effort to integrating their newspaper and broadcast businesses during the integration process. These efforts could divert management’s focus and 

34

* * *

resources from each company’s business, corporate initiatives or strategic opportunities. If Scripps and/or Journal Media Group are unable to integrate operations in a timely and efficient manner, or at all, the anticipated synergies and cost savings of the transactions may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of Scripps class A common shares and Journal Media Group common stock may be affected adversely. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the transactions and any delays encountered in the integration process could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of Scripps and/or Journal Media Group.

Scripps and Journal will incur significant costs in connection with the transactions.

Scripps and Journal expect to pay significant transaction costs in connection with the transactions. These costs include investment banking, legal and accounting fees and expenses, expenses associated with the indebtedness that will be assumed by Scripps in connection with the transactions, SEC filing fees, printing expenses, mailing expenses and other related charges. Scripps estimates its aggregate transaction costs will be approximately $32 million, and Journal estimates its aggregate transaction costs will be approximately $20 million. A portion of the transaction costs will be incurred regardless of whether the transactions are consummated. Scripps and Journal will generally pay their own costs and expenses in connection with the transactions, except that each is obligated to pay 50% of the FCC and HSR filing fees irrespective of whether the transactions are consummated. Scripps and/or Journal Media Group may incur costs associated with integrating the operations of the two companies, and these costs could be significant and could have an adverse effect on Scripps’ and/or Journal Media Group’s future operating results if the anticipated cost savings from the transactions are not achieved. Although Scripps and Journal expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, should allow Scripps and Journal Media Group to offset incremental expenses over time, the net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. For Journal, the spin will create a corporate level tax of between $25 and $35 million. This tax liability will be a liability of the subsidiary of Scripps into which Journal will be merged in the broadcast merger.

While the transactions are pending, Scripps and Journal will be subject to business uncertainties, and contractual restrictions under the master agreement that could have an adverse effect on the businesses of Scripps and Journal.

Uncertainty about the effect of the transactions on Scripps’ and Journal’s employees and business relationships may have an adverse effect on Scripps and Journal and, consequently, on Scripps and Journal Media Group following the completion of the transactions. These uncertainties could impair each party’s ability to retain and motivate key personnel prior to and after the completion of the transactions and could cause third parties who deal with Scripps and Journal to seek to change existing business relationships with Scripps and Journal. If key employees depart or if third parties seek to change business relationships with Scripps and Journal, Scripps’ and Journal Media Group’s business following the completion of the transactions could be adversely affected. In addition, the master agreement restricts Scripps and Journal, without the other party’s consent and subject to certain exceptions, from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions until the transactions close or the master agreement terminates. These restrictions may prevent Scripps and Journal from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to completion of the transactions or termination of the master agreement, and from making other changes to the businesses of Scripps and Journal.

Holders of class A common shares of Scripps will have a reduced ownership and voting interest after the transactions and will exercise less influence over management.

Holders of class A common shares currently have the right to vote in the election of three of the members of the Board of Directors of Scripps. Upon the completion of the transactions, each holder of Scripps class A common shares will have a percentage ownership of Scripps that is smaller than his, hers or its percentage ownership of Scripps immediately prior to the transactions. Because of this, current holders of Scripps class A common shares will have less influence on the management and policies of Scripps than they now have.

Pending litigation against Scripps and Journal could result in an injunction preventing completion of the transactions, the rescission of the transactions in the event they are completed, the payment of damages in the event the transactions are completed and/or may adversely affect Scripps’ and Journal Media Group's business, financial condition or results of operations following the transactions.

In connection with the transactions, a purported shareholder of Journal has filed a putative stockholder class action lawsuit against Journal, the members of the Board of Directors of Journal, Scripps and the other parties to the master agreement. Among other remedies, the plaintiff seeks to enjoin the transactions. See “Litigation Related to the Transactions” on page 142. In addition, one of the conditions to the closing of the transactions is that no material law and no judgment, injunction, order or decree issued by any court of competent jurisdiction shall be in effect that prohibits the consummation of 

35

* * *

the transactions. Consequently, if the plaintiff is successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting Journal or Scripps from consummating the transactions on the agreed-upon terms, then the injunction may prevent the transactions from being completed within the expected timeframe, or at all. Furthermore, if the defendants are not able to resolve the lawsuit, the lawsuit could result in substantial costs to Journal and Scripps, including any costs associated with the indemnification of directors. The defense or settlement of any lawsuit or claim that remains unresolved at the time the transactions are completed may adversely affect the financial condition or results of operations of Scripps and Journal Media Group.

If the spin-offs, newspaper mergers and broadcast merger do not qualify as tax-free transactions, tax could be imposed on shareholders. 

If the spin-offs, newspaper mergers and broadcast merger do not qualify as tax-free transactions, tax could be imposed on Scripps and Journal shareholders. If the spin-offs fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the deemed receipt of shares of Scripps Spinco or Journal Spinco will be treated as a taxable distribution to shareholders. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transactions.”

Titles: DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

<a name="s7282C1B2CAEACD76108050CFB7ADD90A"></a>

DISSENTERS' RIGHTS

Scripps

Under the ORC, Scripps shareholders do not have dissenters' rights with respect to the transactions. 

Journal

Under Wisconsin law, since Journal’s class A common stock is traded on the NYSE, holders of Journal class A common stock will not have dissenters’ rights under Subchapter XIII of the WBCL with respect to the broadcast merger. Holders of Journal class B common stock who do not vote in favor of the broadcast merger and who, at or prior to the Journal special meeting, give to Journal written notice of their objection to the broadcast merger and intent to demand payment for their shares of class B common stock, may demand payment for those shares in the amount equal to the “fair value” of the shares, as determined by Journal or, alternatively, by court determination, but only with respect to the consideration in the broadcast merger. 

The following is a brief summary of the statutory procedures required to be followed by dissenting class B shareholders in order to perfect their rights to seek relief under Subchapter XIII. Although the material provisions of Subchapter XIII set forth in this joint proxy statement/prospectus have been summarized accurately, the statements made concerning that subchapter are not necessarily complete, and reference is made to the full text of Subchapter XIII, attached to this joint proxy statement/prospectus as Annex F. This summary is qualified in its entirety by such reference. Any class B shareholder who may be contemplating the exercise of dissenters’ rights under Subchapter XIII should consult their own legal and financial advisors and should review Subchapter XIII carefully; a failure to precisely comply with any of the statutory requirements may result in a loss of those rights. 

If any class B shareholder elects to dissent from the transaction and to seek an independent determination of the fair value of his, her, or its class B shares under Subchapter XIII, each of the following conditions must be satisfied:

•| The dissenting class B shareholder must deliver (and Journal must receive), prior to the taking of the vote on the transaction, written notice of his, her, or its intent to demand payment of the fair value of his, her, or its shares pursuant to Subchapter XIII if the transaction is consummated. The written notice must reasonably inform Journal of the identity of the dissenting shareholder and of the fact that the dissenting shareholder intends to demand payment of the fair value of his, her, or its shares. The written notice should be delivered to Journal Communications, Inc., 333 West State Street, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53203, Attention: Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Secretary and Chief Compliance Officer. If mailed, it is recommended that the written notice be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. The return of a proxy with an instruction to vote the shares represented thereby against approval of the transaction or to abstain will not, by itself, satisfy the requirement that a written notice demanding payment be filed with Journal.  

199

* * *

|   
---|---  
•| The dissenting class B shareholder’s shares must not be voted in favor of the transaction. This requirement will be satisfied if a proxy (1) is signed and returned with instructions to vote against the transaction, (2) if no proxy is returned, or (3) if the dissenting shareholder attends the Journal special meeting and votes against the transaction or abstains from voting (and, in the case of abstention, has revoked any proxy voting in favor of the transaction). If the dissenting shareholder signs and returns a proxy in the form provided, but does not indicate how the shares represented thereby are to be voted, the shares will be voted in favor of the transaction, and the dissenting shareholder’s right to demand payment for his, her, or its shares will be lost (unless his, her, or its proxy is revoked prior to the voting thereof). Attendance by the dissenting class B shareholder at the Journal special meeting will not in and of itself constitute revocation of a proxy.  

|   
---|---  
•| If the transaction is approved, within ten days after approval, the dissenting class B shareholder will be sent a written dissenters’ notice accompanied by a copy of Subchapter XIII, specifying: (a) where the dissenting class B shareholder must send the payment demand and where and when the book-entry securities for his, her, or its shares must be deposited; (b) a form for demanding payment to be delivered to Journal that includes the date of the first announcement to news media and that requires the dissenting class B shareholder to certify whether he, she, or it acquired beneficial ownership of the class B shares before that date; and (c) the date by which Journal must receive the payment demand.  

|   
---|---  
•| A dissenting class B shareholder who receives a written dissenters’ notice from Journal must demand payment in writing and deposit the book-entry securities for his, her, or its shares in accordance with the terms of that notice. Failure to do so by the date set forth in the notice will result in the dissenting shareholder’s forfeiture of the right to receive payment for his or her shares.  

|   
---|---  
•| Upon the later of receipt of a payment demand or the approval of the transaction, Journal will pay to each dissenting class B shareholder Journal’s estimate of the fair value of his, her, or its shares, plus interest accrued to the date of payment. Journal’s payment must be accompanied by its most recent audited financial statements and the latest available interim financial statements of Journal, a statement of Journal’s estimate of the fair market value of such dissenting shareholder’s class B shares, an explanation of how the interest was calculated, and a statement informing the dissenting class B shareholder of his, her, or its right to demand payment of such class B shareholder’s estimate of the fair value of his, her, or its shares if he, she, or it is dissatisfied with Journal’s payment.   

|   
---|---  
•| If the offer of payment made by Journal is unacceptable to the dissenting class B shareholder, the dissenting class B shareholder may give Journal written notice of such class B shareholder’s estimate of the fair value of the shares and the amount of interest due and demand payment of his, her, or its estimate, less any amounts already paid to such class B shareholder. This demand for payment must be received by Journal within 30 days of his, her, or its receipt of Journal’s offer of payment. A dissenting class B shareholder who fails to make a timely demand for payment will be deemed to have waived his, her, or its right to demand payment.   

|   
---|---  
•| If the dissenting class B shareholder demands payment of his, her, or its estimate of the fair value of his, her, or its class B shares and payment is not paid by Journal, Journal is required to bring a special proceeding within 60 days after receiving the class B shareholder’s payment demand and petition the court to determine the fair value of the class B shareholder’s class B shares and accrued interest. The special proceeding must be brought in the circuit court of Milwaukee County in the State of Wisconsin. Journal shall make all dissenting class B shareholders whose demands remain unsettled parties to the special proceeding. The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and to recommend a decision on the question of fair value. Dissenting class B shareholders are entitled to the same discovery rights as a party in any other civil proceeding. If Journal does not bring the special proceeding within the 60 day period, it shall pay dissenting class B shareholders the amount demanded by such class B shareholder’s estimate of the fair value of the class B shares and the amount of interest due.   

Costs of the special proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court (but excluding the expenses incurred by Journal and the dissenting class B shareholders), will be determined by the court and assessed upon Journal. However, the court may assess those costs against dissenting class B shareholders if it finds that the dissenting class B shareholders acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith in demanding payment greater than Journal’s determination of fair value. 

200

* * *

Journal and dissenting class B shareholders are required to bear their own expenses relating to the special proceeding; however, the court may assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for either party against: (i) Journal, if the court finds Journal did not substantially comply with Subchapter XIII; or (ii) Journal or the dissenting shareholder if the court finds that either acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith with respect to the rights provided by Subchapter XIII.

Although Journal and Scripps believe that the broadcast merger consideration is fair, neither can make any representation as to the outcome of the appraisal of fair value as determined by a Wisconsin court, and class B shareholders should recognize that an appraisal could result in a determination of a lower, higher or equivalent value. 

Dissenting class B shareholders may have different tax results than those of other shareholders. Electing to dissent could potentially change the timing of the payments to be made to the dissenting class B shareholder. Although Section 409A contains provisions addressing disputed payments and has special rules for settlements, the application of these provisions depends on the individuals facts and circumstances. In the event the exercise of the right to dissent causes such payments to be out of compliance with Section 409A, such failure may cause a dissenting shareholder to pay an additional 20% U.S. federal income tax on such amounts. Additionally, amounts received by the dissenting class B shareholder may be treated as “excess parachute payments” that cause the dissenting class B shareholder to pay a 20% excise tax on amounts over the dissenting shareholder’s Base Amount. The application of these provisions will depend on the facts and circumstances of the individual shareholder. The facts and circumstances relating to each dissenting class B shareholder are unknown, and therefore the application of these provisions is uncertain. Journal has not made any determination as to the application of Section 280G to any dissenting class B shareholder. See “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of the Transaction.”

EACH CLASS B SHAREHOLDER IS URGED TO CONSULT WITH HIS, HER, OR ITS OWN TAX ADVISORS WITH RESPECT TO THE APPLICATION OF SECTION 409A AND SECTION 280G AND OTHER TAX CONSEQUENCES OF ELECTING TO DISSENT PRIOR TO MAKING SUCH AN ELECTION.

<a name="sDE2960FA1CA59FE1858350CFA767BEE0"></a>

THE E.W. SCRIPPS COMPANY

SELECTED UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

On June 16, 2014, Scripps acquired two television stations owned by Granite Broadcasting Corporation for $110 million in cash ("the Granite Acquisition."). The Scripps statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, includes the results of the Granite Acquisition for the period from June 16, 2014 through September 30, 2014. 

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations that follows for the year ended December 31, 2013 has been derived from the historical consolidated financial statements of Scripps for the year ended December 31, 2013 which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, the historical consolidated financial statements of Granite for the year ended December 31, 2013, which were previously filed by Scripps with the SEC, and the historical consolidated financial statements of Journal, included in Journal's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 24, 2014, which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information that follows as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 has been derived from unaudited interim condensed combined financial statements of Scripps contained in Scripps' Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2014, which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus, and the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Journal included in Journal's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 28, 2014, which is incorporated by reference into this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the condensed combined statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 have been prepared as though the Granite and Journal acquisitions occurred as of January 1, 2013. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet information at September 30, 2014 has been prepared as if the Journal acquisition occurred as of September 30, 2014. The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and assumptions that management of Scripps believes are reasonable. Such adjustments are estimates and are subject to change.

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are provided for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual results of operations or the financial position of the combined company would be had the transaction occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future combined results of operations or combined financial position. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect any cost savings or other synergies that management of Scripps believes could have been achieved had the acquisitions been completed on the dates indicated.

The acquisition of Journal will be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805. Scripps’s management has evaluated the guidance contained in ASC 805 with respect to the identification of the acquirer in this business combination and concluded, based on a consideration of the pertinent facts and circumstances, that Scripps will acquire Journal for financial accounting purposes. Accordingly, Scripps’s cost to acquire Journal has been allocated to the acquired assets, liabilities and commitments based upon their estimated fair values. The allocation of the purchase price is preliminary and is dependent upon certain valuations that have not progressed to a stage where there is sufficient information to make a final allocation. In addition, the final purchase price of Scripps’ acquisition of Journal will not be known until the date of closing of the transaction and could vary materially from the preliminary purchase price. Accordingly, the final acquisition accounting adjustments may be materially different from the preliminary unaudited pro forma adjustments presented. The actual amounts recorded as of the completion of the transactions may differ materially from the information presented in the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements as a result of several factors, including the following:

|   
---|---  
•| changes in Journal's net assets between the pro forma balance sheet date of September 30, 2014 and the closing of the transactions, which could impact the preliminary estimated purchase price or the preliminary estimated fair value as of the effective date of the transactions;  
|   
---|---  
•| changes in the price of Scripps' class A common shares;  
|   
---|---  
•| the value of the combined company at the effective date of the transactions; and  
|   
---|---  
•| other changes in net assets that may have occurred prior to the completion of the transactions, which could cause material differences in the information presented.  

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements constitute forward-looking information and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 32 and "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements" beginning on page 49. See also "Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information" beginning on page 143.

Titles: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

<a name="s24F5D6599CFE8A58DCBD50CFBEE3D3C7"></a>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes thereto of Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. See "Index to Carve-Out Financial Statements." The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflects plans, estimates and beliefs. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus, particularly in "Risk Factors" and "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

The following discussion reflects the historical results of Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers and may not be indicative of the future performance or reflect what the financial condition and results of operations of Journal Media Group would have been had it operated as a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. For information about the significant accounting policies of Scripps Newspapers and JRN Newspapers, see Note 2 and Note 2, respectively, to their respective financial statements included elsewhere in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

Overview of Transactions

On July 30, 2014, Scripps and Journal entered into the master agreement with Scripps Media, Inc., Desk Spinco, Inc., Scripps NP Operating, LLC (f/k/a Desk NP Operating, LLC), Desk BC Merger, LLC, Boat Spinco, Inc., Journal Media Group (f/k/a Boat NP Newco, Inc.), Desk NP Merger Co., and Boat NP Merger Co.

Newspaper Transactions. Following certain internal contributions and distributions by Scripps and Journal, which are discussed in more detail in this joint proxy statement/prospectus at “Summary - The Transactions” at page 3, and which are illustrated in detail in Annex C to this joint proxy statement/prospectus, Scripps will spin-off Scripps Spinco to its shareholders, and Journal will spin-off Journal Spinco to its shareholders. Pursuant to the master agreement, the shares of Scripps Spinco and Journal Spinco will not be distributed to Scripps shareholders or Journal shareholders, but will be held by the exchange agent for the benefit of Scripps and Journal shareholders until those shares are exchanged for shares of common stock of Journal Media Group in connection with the newspaper mergers. In the Scripps newspaper merger, each share of common stock of Scripps Spinco will automatically be converted into 0.2500 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group. In the Journal newspaper merger, each share of Journal Spinco common stock will be converted into 0.1950 shares of common stock of Journal Media Group. 

Each share of Journal Media Group stock will be issued in accordance with, and subject to the rights and obligations set forth in the articles of incorporation of Journal Media Group. For a comparison of the rights and privileges of a holder of stock of Journal Media Group to the rights and privileges of a holder of Scripps class A common shares or common voting shares and a holder of Journal class A or class B common stock, please see “Comparison of Shareholder Rights” beginning on page 192. 

Upon completion of the newspaper mergers, Journal Media Group common stock is expected to be listed for trading on the NYSE under ticker symbol, “JMG.” It is currently expected that the former Scripps shareholders will hold approximately 59%, and the former Journal shareholders approximately 41%, of the outstanding common stock of Journal Media Group, calculated on a fully-diluted basis, immediately following the newspaper mergers. 

Overview of Journal Media Group 

Following completion of the transactions, Journal Media Group will be a media enterprise with interests in newspapers and local digital media sites. With the ultimate goal of informing, engaging, and empowering readers in the communities we serve, we will provide news, information and value to customers, employees and advertisers. We will serve audiences and businesses through a portfolio of print and digital media brands, including 15 daily newspapers in 14 markets across the United States, and operate an expanding collection of local digital journalism and information businesses.

Journal Media Group is expected to face continued challenges from declines in demand for our printed products. We expect print subscriptions will continue to face pressure as readers find alternative sources to obtain news and information content, including on mobile and other digital platforms. This expected decline in circulation may impact revenue as subscription price increases are unlikely to offset declining subscription volumes and advertising revenue may decline as fewer newspaper inserts are delivered with the printed newspaper. Going forward we expect to manage price increases in an effort to obtain the highest yield from our subscriber base. Many customers are price-sensitive, particularly when we have reduced content they consider valuable. In an effort to minimize customer churn and maximize profitability, we have and will continue 

F- 86

<a name="s24F5D6599CFE8A58DCBD50CFBEE3D3C7"></a>

to use analysis of customer price sensitivity to drive price increases on targeted subscribers and limit the price increases on other subscribers.

In addition, advertising revenue is expected to face continued challenges as advertisers become more sophisticated and targeted with their spending on marketing, either narrowing their geographic distribution to focus on certain areas or shifting their spending to digital media. We will continue to engage our advertisers to determine their needs and leverage our expertise in the markets in which we operate to maximize our share of advertising revenue and look at opportunities to create new products and services and efficient marketplaces connecting advertisers with current and prospective customers.

A portion of our revenue is based on commercial printing and the delivery of other publications, which we expect will experience the same challenges that our newspapers will experience. As our commercial customers reduce page counts and experience declines in circulation, our revenue may also decline. We expect to continue exploring new commercial print and delivery opportunities as our potential customers explore ways to defer capital expenditures for print facilities and explore other cost reduction strategies.

In addition, prior to the newspaper mergers, our business took advantage of the economies of scale of Scripps and Journal. As a separate, stand-alone publicly traded company, we may be unable to obtain goods, services, and technology at prices or on terms as favorable as those obtained prior to the newspaper mergers, which could decrease our overall profitability. However, Journal Media Group will have increased bargaining power with newspaper-specific vendors and can leverage the larger print operation for lower newsprint and other newspaper-specific commodities.

We expect to continue maintaining profitability levels by aligning the cost base with declining revenue levels. We will operate on a number of different front-end / business systems upon completion of the merger. We expect that, over time, we will be able to standardize many of these systems (advertising, circulation, editorial, etc.) and harmonize related business processes. Other functions such as finance, accounting and advertising/circulation operations will require fewer employees as data gathering will be more efficient. Support and other system functions can also be centralized and managed with fewer employees and other related costs. We can also continue to explore changes to our products, such as reduced page size, reduced editorial content and other efficiencies such as combining sections to drive newsprint and production savings.

Finally, management expects to explore the acquisition of publications in additional, attractive markets where there is a strategic fit and appropriate financial return.

Scripps Newspapers Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Executive Overview

Scripps Newspapers owns newspapers and local and national digital media sites. It serves audiences and businesses through a growing portfolio of print and digital media brands. It owns daily newspapers in 13 markets across the United States, and local and national digital journalism and information businesses.

In the first quarter of 2013, Scripps Newspapers launched its bundled-subscription model in its Memphis and Treasure Coast markets. By the end of the third quarter of 2013, all of its newspaper markets had rolled out this model. Under the bundled model, subscribers receive access to all newspaper content on all platforms. Only limited digital content is available to non-subscribers. Scripps Newspapers also offers digital-only subscriptions. It expects to realize the financial benefits of the bundled subscription model in future periods as subscriptions renew and it sells more digital-only subscriptions.

Basis of Presentation — The accompanying combined financial information includes the accounts of Scripps Newspapers, a business representing the principal publishing operations of Scripps, as described below. 

Scripps Newspapers operations consist of daily and community newspapers in 13 markets across the United States. The newspapers earn revenue primarily from the sale of advertising to local and national advertisers and newspaper subscription fees. The newspapers operate in mid-size markets, focusing on news coverage within their local markets. Advertising and subscription revenues provide substantially all of the operating revenues for each newspaper market, and employee, newspaper distribution and newsprint costs are the primary expenses at each newspaper. The daily newspapers published by Scripps Newspapers are the Abilene (TX) Reporter-News, the Anderson (SC) Independent-Mail, the Corpus Christi (TX) Caller-Times, the Evansville (IN) Courier & Press, the Henderson (KY) Gleaner, the Kitsap (WA) Sun, the Knoxville (TN) News Sentinel, the Memphis (TN) Commercial Appeal, the Naples (FL) Daily News, the Redding (CA) Record-Searchlight, the San Angelo (TX) Standard-Times, the Treasure Coast (FL) News/Press/Tribune, the Ventura County (CA) Star and the Wichita Falls (TX) Times Record News. The business also includes a 40% ownership in the Albuquerque Publishing Company, which publishes the Albuquerque Journal (NM). 

Historically, separate financial statements have not been prepared for the Company. These combined financial statements reflect the historical financial position, results of operations, changes in parent company equity and cash flows of the Company for the periods presented, as the Company was historically managed within Scripps (the "Parent"). The combined financial statements have been prepared on a “carve-out” basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Scripps. The combined financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). Management believes that assumptions and methodologies underlying the allocation of general corporate expenses are reasonable (see Note 11 to the combined financial statements). However, such expenses may not be indicative of the actual level of expense that would have been incurred had the Company operated as a separate stand-alone entity, and, accordingly, may not necessarily reflect the Company's combined financial position, results of operations and cash flows had the Company operated as a stand-alone entity during the periods presented.

2013 compared with 2012

Revenues by category were as follows:

Total revenues|  | $| 384,199|   
|  | (3.7| )%|  | $| 399,123|   

Advertising and marketing services revenues decreased 5.5% for 2013, primarily as a result of continued secular changes in the demand for print advertising. Automotive and employment classified advertising and national advertising remained particularly weak. Subscription revenue was essentially flat due to print and digital subscription bundles and targeted price increases.

Preprint and other revenues declined at a slightly slower pace than other print advertising. Preprint and other products include inserts and single-sheet advertisements included with the daily newspaper, niche publications such as community newspapers, lifestyle magazines, publications focused on the classified advertising categories of real estate, employment and auto, and other publications aimed at younger readers. Scripps Newspapers has been increasing its efforts to sell single-sheet advertisements delivered with newspapers and to all homes in a market (the “print and deliver” initiative).

Digital advertising and marketing services include advertising on newspaper Internet sites, digital advertising provided through audience-extension programs, such as an arrangement with Yahoo!, and other digital marketing services offered to local advertising customers, such as managing their search engine marketing campaigns. 

Subscriptions include fees paid by readers for access to content in print and digital formats. Scripps Newspapers completed the launch of its bundled subscription model in the third quarter of 2013. Under the Scripps Newspapers bundled offerings, home delivery subscribers receive access to all newspaper content on all platforms and only limited digital content is available to non-subscribers. Scripps Newspapers also offers digital-only subscriptions. Subscription revenue was flat year over year, but increased in the third and fourth quarters of 2013 — the first year-over-year increase since the fourth quarter of 2010. The positive trend was driven by the rollout of the bundled subscription model and increases in single-copy prices in select markets. As Scripps Newspapers has cycled against the completion of the launch of its digital bundles in the second half of 2014, subscription revenue growth has moderated. 

Other operating revenues, including commercial printing and distribution services, were up slightly year over year. In 2013 Scripps Newspapers had revenues of $1.6 million for a commercial print job where our Knoxville newspaper printed the Chattanooga newspaper while their plant was improved. The Chattanooga printing contract was completed in August 2014.

Costs of sales were as follows:

Total cost of sales|  | $| 213,488|   
|  | (3.0| )%|  | $| 220,030|   

Employee compensation and benefits were flat year over year as Scripps Newspapers limited reductions in employee levels in the newsrooms to maintain the quality of the news content. 

Newsprint, press supplies and other printing costs declined by 8.2% in 2013 due to lower expenditures for newsprint. Average newsprint prices decreased 7% and newsprint consumption decreased approximately 5% for 2013. Total newsprint consumption declined due to the reduced number of pages in publications, reflecting the declines in advertising volumes, and lower print runs due to declining print circulation.

Newspaper distribution costs decreased by 3.7% in 2013 compared to 2012 as a result of lower circulation levels. A large portion of newspaper distribution costs are variable and increase or decrease in relation to circulation levels.

Selling, general and administrative were as follows:

Total selling, general and administrative|  | $| 167,803|   
|  | 0.6|  %|  | $| 166,845|   

Employee compensation and benefits decreased primarily due to lower employment levels year over year. Scripps Newspapers had approximately 5% fewer employees in 2013 compared to 2012.

<a name="s260F1A6E13977DF29C0050CF9E4D597F"></a>

Marketing and promotion increased by 36.1% in 2013, primarily due to marketing and promotion to support the launch of the Scripps Newspapers bundled subscription offerings. 

Corporate Allocation from Parent — The combined financial statements include expense allocations from the Parent of Scripps Newspapers for certain corporate support services, which are recorded within selling, general and administrative expense in the Combined Statements of Operations. Management believes that the basis used for the allocations are reasonable and reflect the portion of such costs attributed to Scripps Newspapers operations; however, the amounts may not be representative of the costs necessary to operate as a separate stand-alone company. The management of Scripps Newspapers is unable to determine what such costs would have been had Scripps Newspapers been independent. Following the completion of the transactions, Scripps Newspapers will perform these functions using its own resources or purchased services.

The corporate allocation includes costs related to support Scripps Newspapers received from its Parent for certain corporate activities including: (i) executive management, (ii) corporate development, (iii) corporate relations, (iv) legal, (v) human resources, (vi) internal audit, (vii) financial reporting, (viii) tax, (ix) treasury, (x) centralized accounting, and (xi) other Parent corporate and infrastructure costs. For these services, actual costs incurred by the Parent were allocated to Scripps Newspapers based upon on a number of utilization measures including headcount, square footage, and proportionate effort. Where determinations based on utilization were impracticable, Scripps Newspapers used other methods and criteria that are believed to be reasonable estimates of costs attributable to the Scripps Newspapers, such as net sales.

The corporate allocation increased in 2013 primarily due to costs to support digital initiatives including hiring additional sales resources and costs for the roll-out of Scripps Newspapers digital subscription model.

Depreciation

Depreciation expense decreased year-over-year due to assets that were fully depreciated in prior years.

Tax provision

The effective income tax rate was 11.1% and 2.8% for 2013 and 2012, respectively. In both years there were approximately $0.4 million of state taxes. For the 2013 and 2012 Scripps Newspapers recorded a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets for federal and certain state income taxes as it is more likely than not that Scripps Newspapers will not realize these benefits as a result of the negative evidence from its history of losses over the past three years. In accordance with the intraperiod tax allocation rules, in 2013, Scripps Newspapers allocated $2.3 of tax expense to other comprehensive income and treated the corresponding offset as an allocation to tax benefit from operations.

Print advertising revenues declined as secular changes in the demand for newspaper advertising continued to affect the operating revenue of newspaper publishers throughout the country. Revenues also declined from our efforts to rationalize unprofitable product offerings. Advertising revenues associated with discontinued products totaled approximately $5.0 million

in 2011. Automotive and employment classified advertising and advertising by large national retailers, which tend to make advertising decisions at the national or regional level, not at the local market level, remained particularly weak. 

Preprint and other revenues declined at a slightly slower pace than other print advertising. Preprint and other products include inserts and single-sheet advertisements distributed in the daily newspaper, niche publications such as community newspapers, lifestyle magazines, publications focused on the classified advertising categories of real estate, employment and auto, and other publications aimed at younger readers. 

Digital revenues include advertising on newspaper Internet sites, digital advertising provided through audience-extension programs, such as an arrangement with Yahoo!, and other digital marketing services offered to local advertising customers, such as managing their search engine marketing campaigns. 

Subscription revenue decreased in 2012 compared to 2011 as price increases in home delivery and single copy did not offset declines in circulation net paid levels. Net paid levels decreased approximately 5% due to fewer home delivery subscriptions and lower single-copy sales on Sunday.

Other operating revenues, including commercial printing and distribution services, increased due to the impact of initiatives to garner additional revenues in these areas.

Employee compensation and benefits decreased 10.1% due to lower employment levels as a result of the 2011 fourth quarter reduction in force initiative and attrition. The number of employees decreased approximately 11% year-over-year. 

Newsprint, press supplies and other printing costs decreased 3.0% in 2012 compared to 2011. Lower newsprint consumption reduced costs by $1.3 million. Total newsprint consumption declined due to the reduced number of pages in publications, reflecting the declines in advertising volumes, and lower print runs due to declining print circulation.

Newspaper distribution costs decreased by 1.4% in 2012 compared to 2011 as a result of lower circulation levels. A large portion of newspaper distribution costs are variable and increase or decrease in relation to circulation levels.

Other decreased by 24.1% due to cost cutting measures.

Employee compensation and benefits decreased due to lower employment levels as a result of the 2011 fourth quarter reduction in force initiative, attrition and the shifting of employees from the Scripps Newspapers to parents centralized IT group which in 2012 is included as part of the allocation of Scripps overhead.

Corporate Allocation from Parent — The combined financial statements include expense allocations from the Parent of Scripps Newspapers for certain corporate support services, which are recorded within selling, general and administrative expense in the Combined Statements of Operations. Management believes that the basis used for the allocations are reasonable and reflect the portion of such costs attributed to Scripps Newspapers operations; however, the amounts may not be representative of the costs necessary to operate as a separate stand-alone company.

For these services, actual costs incurred by the Parent were allocated to Scripps Newspapers based upon on a number of utilization measures including headcount, square footage, and proportionate effort. Where determinations based on utilization were impracticable, Scripps Newspapers used other methods and criteria that are believed to be reasonable estimates of costs attributable to the Scripps Newspapers, such as net sales.

The corporate allocation increased in 2012 primarily due to the shifting of employees from Scripps Newspapers to the Parent's centralized digital operations function. During 2012, this function was centralized and built out with common staff and solutions. In 2012, the charge for this group is included as part of the allocation of Parent overhead.

Depreciation

Depreciation decreased year-over-year due to assets that were fully depreciated in prior years.

Impairment of long-lived assets

In 2011, Scripps Newspapers recorded a $9 million non-cash charge to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets at four of its newspapers. The estimates of cumulative undiscounted future cash flows at these properties were not sufficient to recover the $36 million carrying value of the assets and Scripps Newspapers wrote them down to their estimated fair value of $27 million. 

Tax provision

The effective income tax rate was 2.8% and 2.7% for 2012 and 2011, respectively. In both years there were approximately $0.5 million of state taxes. For 2012 and 2011, Scripps Newspapers recorded a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets for federal and certain state income taxes as it is more likely than not that it will not realize these benefits as a result of the negative evidence from a history of losses over the past three years.

Cash flow provided by operating activities increased by $0.9 million in 2012 compared to 2011. The increase was primarily attributable to lower pretax loss in 2012 compared to 2011, after adjustment for the 2011 impairment charge of $9 million.

Investing activities

Cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31 is as follows:

In 2013, 2012 and 2011 we used $3.3 million, $3.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively, in cash for investing activities. Increased capital expenditures was the reason for the year-over-year changes.

Financing activities

Cash provided by financing activities was $5.2 million in 2013 and cash used in financing activities was $2.4 million and $3.4 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Our Parent, provided cash as needed to fund our operating activities and retains any excess cash flow.

Other

Scripps Newspapers participates in its Parent's controlled disbursement system. The bank sends daily notifications of checks presented for payment and transfers funds from other sources to cover the checks. Scripps Newspapers cash balance held by its Parent is reduced as checks are issued. Accordingly, none of the Parent's cash and cash equivalents has been assigned to Scripps Newspapers in the combined financial statements. Further, outstanding checks issued by the Parent are not recorded as a liability once the check is signed, as the obligation becomes tied to the central cash management arrangement. 

The Combined Company (Journal Media Group)

Following the completion of the transactions, Journal Media Group's capital structure and sources of liquidity will be significantly different from Scripps Newspapers historical capital structure. Journal Media Group will no longer participate in cash management and funding arrangements with its Parent. Instead, its ability to fund cash needs will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and borrow under a line of credit it expects to arrange. If Journal Media Group's cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected, it will need to borrow under its proposed line of credit and may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity. Although Journal Media Group expects at the time of the closing of the transactions to have in place a credit facility to finance its operations on acceptable terms and conditions, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including (i) its credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iii) the current state of the economy. It is expected that Journal Media Group's primary future cash needs will be for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual commitments and strategic investments. 

On a pro forma as adjusted basis giving effect to the transactions, Journal Media Group would have had cash and cash equivalents of $10 million as of September 30, 2014. It is expected that cash provided by operating activities and available capacity under Journal Media Group's proposed line of credit will provide sufficient funds to operate its business and meet its other liquidity needs for the twelve months following the closing of the transactions. It is expected that Journal Media Group will generate positive free cash flow for the twelve months following the closing of the transactions.

Other Contractual Obligations — In the ordinary course of business, long-term contracts to lease office space and equipment, and to purchase other goods and services are entered into.

Operating Leases — Scripps Newspapers obtains certain office and warehouse space under multi-year lease agreements. Leases for office and warehouse space are generally not cancelable prior to their expiration.

F- 95

<a name="s260F1A6E13977DF29C0050CF9E4D597F"></a>

Leases for operating and office equipment are generally cancelable by either party with 30 to 90 day notice. However, such contracts are expected to remain in force throughout the terms of the leases. The amounts included in the table above represent the amounts due under the agreements assuming the agreements are not canceled prior to their expiration.

It is expected that the operating leases will be renewed or replaced with similar agreements upon their expiration.

Pension Funding — Scripps Newspapers sponsors certain qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover certain non-union and certain union-represented employees. 

Contractual commitments summarized in the contractual obligations table include payments to meet minimum funding requirements of Scripps Newspapers defined benefit pension plans. Contractual pension obligations reflect anticipated minimum statutory pension contributions as of December 31, 2013, based upon pension funding regulations in effect at the time and current pension assumptions regarding discount rates and returns on plan assets. Actual funding requirements may differ from amounts presented due to changes in discount rates, returns on plan assets or pension funding regulations that are in effect at the time.

Purchase Commitments — Scripps Newspapers obtains certain other services under multi-year agreements. These agreements are generally not cancelable prior to expiration of the service agreement. It is expected that such agreements will be renewed or replaced with similar agreements upon their expiration.

Scripps Newspapers may also enter into contracts with certain vendors and suppliers, including most of its newsprint vendors. These contracts typically do not require the purchase of fixed or minimum quantities and generally may be terminated at any time without penalty. Included in the table of contractual obligations are purchase orders placed as of December 31, 2013. Purchase orders placed with vendors, including those with whom we maintain contractual relationships, are generally cancelable prior to shipment. While these vendor agreements do not require the purchase of a minimum quantity of goods or services, and generally the orders can be canceled prior to shipment, Scripps Newspapers expects expenditures for goods and services in future periods will approximate those in prior years.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires Scripps Newspapers to make a variety of decisions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures, including the selection of appropriate accounting principles and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates. In reaching such decisions, Scripps Newspapers applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances, including its historical experience, actuarial studies and other assumptions. Scripps Newspapers is committed to incorporating accounting principles, assumptions and estimates that promote the representational faithfulness, verifiability, neutrality and transparency of the accounting information included in the combined financial statements.

The Notes to the Combined Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies that have been selected for use in the preparation of Scripps Newspapers financial statements and related disclosures. Scripps Newspapers believes the following to be the most critical accounting policies, estimates and assumptions affecting its reported amounts and related disclosures.

Long-Lived Assets — Long-lived assets (primarily property, plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets) must be tested for impairment whenever events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset group is determined not to be recoverable if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the asset group are less than the carrying value of the asset group. 

Estimating undiscounted cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates. Scripps Newspapers continually monitors the estimated cash flows of its newspaper properties and may incur impairment charges if future cash flows are less than current estimates.

Income Taxes — The accounting for uncertain tax positions and the application of income tax law is inherently complex. As such, Scripps Newspapers is required to make many assumptions and judgments regarding its income tax positions and the likelihood of whether such tax positions would be sustained if challenged. Interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As such, changes in Scripps Newspapers assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the combined financial statements.

The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax 

F- 96

* * *

<a name="s260F1A6E13977DF29C0050CF9E4D597F"></a>

liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable losses and projections for future taxable loss over the periods in which the net deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely that Scripps Newspapers will not realize the benefit of most of its net deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, in jurisdictions in which there is a net deferred tax asset, Scripps Newspapers has established a full valuation allowance. 

Scripps Newspapers is required to assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets, which include net operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years, will be recoverable from the carryback to prior years, carryforward to future years or through other prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If recovery is not likely, Scripps Newspapers has to provide a valuation allowance based on its estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions, and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable. The provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations by various taxing authorities. Actual results could differ from our estimates and if Scripps Newspapers determines that the deferred tax asset Scripps Newspapers would realize would be greater or less than the net amount recorded, an adjustment would be made to the tax provision in that period.

Pension Plans — Scripps, the Parent of Scripps Newspapers, sponsors various noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time employees that began employment prior to June 30, 2008 (the majority of the defined benefit pension plans were frozen June 30, 2009), including a SERP, which covers certain executive employees. Total Scripps defined benefit pension plan expense for those plans was $8.8 million in 2013, $8.6 million in 2012 and $8.1 million in 2011.

Scripps Newspapers has accounted for its participation in the Scripps Pension Plan as a participant in a multi-employer plan. Expense has been determined on a participant basis and included in the combined financial statements of the Company. As a participant in a multi-employer plan, no assets or liabilities are included in the Combined Balance Sheets of Scripps Newspapers other than contributions currently due and unpaid to the plan. 

Scripps Newspapers also has four plans that are sponsored directly by Scripps Newspapers Memphis and Knoxville newspapers. The liabilities related to these plans are included in the Combined Balance Sheets of Scripps Newspapers. 

Scripps Newspapers has accounted for its participation in the Scripps Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") as a separate stand alone plan. Under this method, Scripps Newspapers has accounted for the allocation of the benefit obligations specifically related to its employees and its estimated portion of the plan assets, if any. The total SERP pension expense was allocated to Scripps Newspapers based on the Scripps Newspaper's share of the service cost and benefit obligations, in addition to its expected return on its portion of the SERP assets. 

The carve-out financial statements have been allocated $4.2 million, $4.6 million and $3.5 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, of pension expense of Scripps Newspapers' parent.

The measurement of Scripps pension obligation and related expense is dependent on a variety of estimates, including: discount rates; expected long-term rate of return on plan assets; expected increase in compensation levels; and employee turnover, mortality and retirement ages. Scripps reviews these assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate. In accordance with accounting principles, Scripps records the effects of these modifications currently or amortize them over future periods. Scripps considers the most critical of its pension estimates to be the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.

The assumptions used in accounting for Scripps defined benefit pension plans for 2013 and 2012 are as follows:  

---  
| | | | |   
| 2013|  | 2012  
|  |  |   
Discount rate for expense| 4.27| %|  | 5.27| %  
Discount rate for obligations| 5.08| %|  | 4.27| %  
Long-term rate of return on plan assets| 4.65| %|  | 5.30| %  

The discount rate used to determine Scripps future pension obligations is based upon a dedicated bond portfolio approach that includes securities rated Aa or better with maturities matching our expected benefit payments from the plans. The rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date and affects the succeeding year’s pension cost. Discount rates can change from year to year based on economic conditions that impact corporate bond yields. A decrease in the discount rate increases pension obligations and pension expense.

F- 97

<a name="s260F1A6E13977DF29C0050CF9E4D597F"></a>

For Scripps defined benefit pension plans, as of December 31, 2013, a half percent increase or decrease in the discount rate would have the following effect:  

---  
| | | | | | | |   
(in thousands)|  | 0.5%Increase|  | 0.5%Decrease  
|  |  |  |   
Effect on total pension expense in 2014|  | $| (618| )|  | $| 469|   

Effect on pension benefit obligation as of December 31, 2013|  | $| (35,256| )|  | $| 37,829|   

Scripps has target asset allocations to invest plan assets in securities that match the timing of the payment of plan obligations. As a result, approximately 70% of plan assets are invested in a portfolio of fixed income securities with a duration approximately that of the projected payment of benefit obligations. The remaining 30% of plan assets are invested in equity securities and other return-seeking assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based primarily upon the target asset allocation for plan assets and capital markets forecasts for each asset class employed. Scripps expected rate of return on plan assets also considers its historical compound rate of return on plan assets for 10- and 15-year periods. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets increases pension expense. A 0.5% change in the 2014 expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.3%, to either 4.8% or 5.8%, would increase or decrease Scripps 2014 pension expense by approximately $2.2 million.

Total revenues|  | $| 275,230|   
|  | (2.0| )%|  | $| 280,978|   

Total newspaper revenues decreased 2.0% for nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to 2013. Advertising and marketing services revenues decreased 6.1% in 2014 which was partially offset by an increase in subscription revenue from print and digital subscription bundles and targeted price increases. As of September 30, 2014, Scripps Newspapers had approximately 38,000 digital-only subscribers across all of our markets. 

Advertising and marketing services declined primarily as a result of continued secular changes in the demand for print advertising. Automotive classified advertising, as well as both local and national advertising, remained particularly weak during the period.

Subscriptions include fees paid by readers for access to content in print and digital formats. Scripps Newspapers completed the launch of its bundled subscription model in the third quarter of 2013. Under its bundled offerings, subscribers receive access to all of Scripps Newspapers content on all platforms and only limited digital content is available to non-

<a name="sBDCF91385EC90E5C774B50CF9EC2673E"></a>

subscribers. Scripps Newspapers also offer digital-only subscriptions. Subscription revenue increased 5.0% for the first nine months of 2014 which was driven by the rollout of the bundled subscription model, increases in single-copy prices and digital-only subscriptions. As we have cycled against the completion of the launch of our digital bundles, subscription revenue growth has moderated. 

Other operating revenues, including commercial printing and distribution services, increased by $0.8 million, or 5.4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. In 2014 and 2013, Scripps Newspapers had revenues of $2.1 million and $0.6 million, respectively, for a commercial print job where our Knoxville newspaper printed the Chattanooga newspaper while their plant was improved. The Chattanooga printing contract was completed in August 2014.

Total costs of goods sold|  | $| 153,967|   
|  | (3.0| )%|  | $| 158,747|   

Employee compensation and benefits decreased 2.2%, primarily due to lower employment levels compared to prior year. Scripps Newspapers had approximately 6% fewer newspaper employees in 2014 as compared to 2013.

Newsprint, press supplies and other printing costs declined by 5.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to lower expenditures for newsprint. Average newsprint prices decreased 3.4% and newsprint consumption decreased nearly 4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

Newspaper distribution costs decreased by 2.2% for the year-to-date period compared to prior year as a result of lower circulation levels. A large portion of our distribution costs are variable and increase or decrease in relation to circulation levels.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling, general and administrative were as follows:

Total selling, general and administrative|  | $| 124,409|   
|  | (0.7| )%|  | $| 125,286|   

Employee compensation and benefits decreased 6.3% due to lower employment levels compared to prior year from attrition and the transfer of approximately 15 Scripps Newspaper information technology ("IT") employees into the corporate IT group. The employee compensation and benefits for IT is included in the corporate allocation described below for 2014.

Other expenses decreased primarily due to the centralization of the Scripps Newspapers function into the corporate IT group. The IT expense is included in the corporate allocation described below for 2014.

Corporate Allocation from Parent — The combined financial statements include expense allocations from the Parent of Scripps Newspapers for certain corporate support services, which are recorded within selling, general and administrative expense in the Combined Statements of Operations. Management believes that the basis used for the allocations are reasonable and reflect the portion of such costs attributed to Scripps Newspapers operations; however, the amounts may not be representative of the costs necessary to operate as a separate stand-alone company. Management of Scripps Newspapers is unable to determine what such costs would have been had Scripps Newspapers been independent. Following the completion of the transactions, Scripps Newspapers will perform these functions using its own resources or purchased services.

The corporate allocation includes costs related to support Scripps Newspapers received from its Parent for certain corporate activities including: (i) executive management, (ii) corporate development, (iii) corporate relations, (iv) legal, (v) human resources, (vi) internal audit, (vii) financial reporting, (viii) tax, (ix) treasury, (x) centralized accounting, and (xi) other Parent corporate and infrastructure costs. For these services, actual costs incurred by the Parent were allocated to Scripps Newspapers based upon on a number of utilization measures including headcount, square footage, and proportionate effort. Where determinations based on utilization were impracticable, Scripps Newspapers used other methods and criteria that are believed to be reasonable estimates of costs attributable to the Scripps Newspapers such as net sales.

The corporate allocation increased in 2014 primarily due to costs for IT which were centralized in the corporate function in 2014 and now included in the corporate allocation.

Marketing and promotion decreased by almost 24% in 2014, primarily due to incurring additional marketing and promotion to support the launch of the Scripps Newspapers bundled subscription offerings in 2013, which was not repeated in 2014. 

Tax provision

The effective income tax rate was 0.9% and 0.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In both periods there was approximately $0.3 million of state taxes. For the 2014 and 2013 periods, Scripps Newspapers has recorded a valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets for federal and certain state income taxes as it is more likely than not that Scripps Newspapers will not realize these benefits as a result of the negative evidence from its history of losses over the past three years. In accordance with the intraperiod tax allocation rules, in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 we allocated $0.1 million of tax expense to other comprehensive income and treated the corresponding offset as an allocation to tax benefit from operations.

The $4.1 million increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to changes in working capital in 2014 compared to 2013 and the $4.1 million liability that was recorded for withdrawing from one of the multi-employer pension plans partially offset by a higher net loss in 2014. The primary factors affecting changes in working capital was a $2.9 million increase in collections of accounts receivable and an increase in accruals related to employee compensation and benefits which increased working capital by $3.1 million. The timing of payments for accounts payable decreased working capital by $1.6 million in 2014.

Investing activities

Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30 is as follows:

In 2014 and 2013, Scripps Newspapers used $1.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively, in cash for investing activities. Lower capital expenditures in 2014 compared to the prior period was the primary driver of the year-over-year changes.

Financing activities

Cash used in financing activities was $3.9 million in 2014 and cash provided by financing activities was $1.3 million in 2013. Our parent, provides cash as needed to fund deficient operating activities.

Other

Scripps Newspapers participates in its Parent's controlled disbursement system. The bank sends daily notifications of checks presented for payment and transfers funds from other sources to cover the checks. Scripps Newspapers cash balance held by its Parent is reduced as checks are issued. Accordingly, none of the parent's cash and cash equivalents has been assigned to Scripps Newspapers in the combined financial statements. Further, outstanding checks issued by the Parent are not recorded as a liability once the check is signed, the obligation becomes tied to the central cash management arrangement.

The Combined Company

Following the completion of the transactions, Journal Media Group's capital structure and sources of liquidity will be significantly different from Scripps Newspapers historical capital structure. Journal Media Group will no longer participate in cash management and funding arrangements with its parent. Instead, its ability to fund cash needs will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and borrow under a line of credit it expects to arrange. If Journal Media Group's cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected, it will need to borrow under its proposed line of credit and may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity. Although Journal Media Group expects at the time of the closing of the transactions to have in place a credit facility to finance its operations on acceptable terms and conditions, its access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including (i) its credit ratings or absence of a credit rating, (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (iii) the current state of the economy. It is expected that Journal Media Groups primary future cash needs will be for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual commitments and strategic investments. 

On a pro forma as adjusted basis giving effect to the transactions, Journal Media Group would have had cash and cash equivalents of $10 million as of September 30, 2014. It is expected that cash provided by operating activities and available capacity under Journal Media Group's proposed line of credit will provide sufficient funds to operate its business and meet its other liquidity needs for the twelve months following the closing of the transactions. It is expected that Journal Media Group will generate positive free cash flow for the twelve months following the closing of the transactions.

JRN Newspapers Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this joint proxy statement/prospectus, including “Risk Factors,” “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” "Journal Media Group Selected Financial Data," “Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information,” “Business of Journal Media Group,” and the combined financial statements and the notes thereto included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements.

We believe that the assumptions underlying the combined financial statements included in the information statement are reasonable. However, the combined financial statements may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows for future periods or what they would have been had JRN Newspapers been a separate, stand-alone company during the periods presented.

Overview

On July 30, 2014, Journal Communications, Inc. (“Journal”) announced that its Board of Directors approved transactions pursuant to which Journal and The E.W. Scripps Company (“Scripps”) would merge their broadcast operations and spin-off and then combine their newspaper businesses into a separate publicly traded company (the “Transactions”). The newspaper company will be named Journal Media Group and will combine Journal's publishing businesses, including Journal Sentinel, Inc. and Journal Community Publishing Group, Inc. (“JRN Newspapers”), with 13 Scripps’ newspapers. Journal Media Group will be headquartered in Milwaukee. Journal will be the acquired company in the Transactions.

JRN Newspapers' business segments are based on the organizational structure used by management for making operating and investment decisions and for assessing performance. Our reportable business segments are: (i) daily newspapers; and (ii) community publications. Results from our digital media assets are included in both segments. Our daily newspapers segment consists of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which serves as the only major daily newspaper for the Milwaukee metropolitan area. Our community publications segment consists of several community publications, primarily in southeastern Wisconsin, as well as print facilities in West Milwaukee and Waupaca, Wisconsin. 

In recent years, newspaper industry fundamentals have declined as a result of the 2009 recession and secular industry changes. Retail and classified run-of-press (ROP) advertising have decreased from historic levels due in part to department store consolidation, weakened employment, automotive and real estate economics and a migration of advertising to the Internet and other advertising forms. Circulation volume declines and online competition have also negatively impacted newspaper industry revenues. We do not expect that revenues at our daily newspapers or community publications will return to revenue levels reported in 2013 or prior years given the secular changes affecting the newspaper industry.

Separation from Journal Communications, Inc. and Basis of Presentation

Historically, separate financial statements have not been prepared for JRN Newspapers. The accompanying combined financial statements were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Journal. These combined financial statements have been prepared to present JRN Newspapers’ historical results of operations, financial position, and cash flows for the indicated periods as it was historically managed. The accompanying combined financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

The accompanying combined financial statements include the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses that are specifically identifiable to JRN Newspapers, including certain assets which were historically owned by Journal. In addition, certain costs related to JRN Newspapers have been allocated from Journal, including costs for shared services, support functions, administrative costs, and corporate shared employees. The allocated costs included in the combined financial statements were calculated using appropriate allocation methodologies and are disclosed as related party transactions in Note 3 “Related Party Transactions and Parent Company Investment”. Income taxes have been accounted for on a separate return basis in these financial statements as described in Note 10 “Income Taxes”. 

Management believes the assumptions and allocations underlying the combined financial statements are reasonable. The expenses and cost allocation are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to or the benefit received by JRN Newspapers during the periods presented, relative to the total costs incurred by Journal. However, the amounts recorded for these allocations are not necessarily representative of the amount that would have been reflected in the financial statements had JRN Newspapers been an entity that operated independently of Journal.

In connection with the spin-off, JRN Newspapers has entered into various agreements with Scripps and expects to enter into various agreements with other third parties that may be on different terms than the terms of the arrangements or agreements which existed prior to the spin-off. For instance, JRN Newspapers utilizes the services of Journal and its subsidiaries for certain functions, such as legal, finance, human resources and information technology. Consequently, future results of operations for JRN Newspapers will include costs and expenses that may be materially different than Journal's historical results of operations, financial positions, and cash flows. Accordingly, the financial statements for these periods are not indicative of JRN Newspapers’ future results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

All intercompany balances and transactions within JRN Newspapers have been eliminated. Transactions and balances between JRN Newspapers and Journal and its subsidiaries are reflected as related party transactions within these financial statements. Except for amounts due to Journal for borrowed funds payable on demand, the accumulated net effect of intercompany transactions between JRN Newspapers and Journal and its subsidiaries is considered to be effectively settled through the parent company investment, a component of equity. The accumulated net effect of intercompany transactions, including cash advances with Journal and its subsidiaries, is reflected in the combined statements of cash flows as financing activities. Current income taxes are also assumed to be settled with Journal through the parent company investment in the period the related income taxes were recorded.

JRN Newspapers determined it has two reportable segments in accordance with ASC Topic 280, “Segment Reporting.” Business decisions at JRN Newspapers are made by the chief operating decision maker within Journal Sentinel, Inc. and business segments are based on the organizational structure used by management for making operating and investing decisions and for assessing performance: Daily Newspaper (Journal Sentinel, Inc.) and Community Publications (Journal Community Publications Group, Inc.).

Impact of Separation from Journal on JRN Newspapers’ Financial Statements

JRN Newspapers participates in a number of corporate-wide programs administered by Journal and its subsidiaries. These include participation in Journal’s centralized treasury function, insurance programs, employee benefit programs, workers’ compensation programs, and centralized service centers and other corporate functions. The following is a discussion of the relationship with Journal, the services provided and how transactions with Journal and its subsidiaries have been accounted for in the combined financial statements.

JRN Newspapers received allocated charges from Journal for certain corporate support services, which are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. Outstanding balances that are legally bound by a formal intercompany agreement are a component of the related party payable. Intercompany dividends paid to Journal by JRN Newspapers have been separately disclosed. Charges that are not supported by a formal intercompany agreement are a component of parent company equity. Management believes that the basis used for the allocations are reasonable and reflect the portion of such costs attributed to JRN Newspapers’ operations; however, the amounts may not be representative of the costs necessary for JRN Newspapers to operate as a separate stand-alone company. Actual costs that would have been incurred if it had been a stand-alone company would depend on multiple factors, including organization structure and various strategic decisions.

Interim and Annual Goodwill Impairment Tests

Our annual impairment tests on goodwill associated with our daily newspapers reporting unit and our community publications reporting unit as of September 30, 2013, the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, indicated there was no impairment of our goodwill.

For purposes of testing the carrying value of goodwill related to our daily newspapers and community publications reporting units, we determine fair value using an income and a market valuation approach. The income approach uses expected cash flows of the reporting unit. The cash flows are discounted for risk and time value. In addition, the present value of the projected residual value is estimated and added to the present value of the cash flows. The market approach is based on price multiples of publicly traded stocks of comparable companies to estimate fair value. Each approach estimated a fair value exceeding carrying value. We assign a greater weight to the income approach as the market approach is deemed less reliable due to the differences in entity size and business model between our combined publishing reporting unit and the comparable companies selected. We base our fair value estimates on various assumptions about our projected operating results, including continuing declines in publishing revenues as well as an expectation that we will achieve cash flow benefits from our continuing cost cutting measures. The valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit requires inputs and assumptions (i.e., market growth, operating cash flow margins and discount rates) that reflect current market conditions as well as management judgment. These assumptions may change due to changes in market conditions and such changes may result in an impairment of our goodwill.

There is no goodwill in the daily newspaper reporting unit. We based the valuation of goodwill related to our community publications reporting unit on our internal projections and industry-based assumptions:

Results of Operations

JRN Newspapers reports on a 52-53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday of December in each year. In addition, JRN Newspapers has four quarterly reporting periods, each consisting of thirteen weeks and ending on a Sunday, provided that once every six years the fourth quarterly reporting period will be fourteen weeks. The fourth quarterly reporting period in JRN Newspapers’ 2012 fiscal year consisted of fourteen weeks. JRN Newspapers’ 2013 and 2011 fiscal years each were comprised of a 52-week period. JRN Newspapers’ 2012 fiscal ended on December 30, 2012 and was comprised of a 53-week period.

2013 (52 weeks) Compared to 2012 (53 weeks)

The year ended 2013 contained 52 weeks compared to 53 weeks in 2012. Although it is difficult to precisely quantify the impact of the one less week, we estimate the revenue impact to be an increase to 2012 as compared to 2013 of $2.8 million and the operating earnings impact to be $0.4 million.

Our combined revenue in 2013 was $153.3 million, a decrease of $10.6 million, or 6.5%, compared to $163.9 million in 2012. Our combined operating costs and expenses in 2013 were $101.1 million, a decrease of $6.2 million, or 5.8%, compared to $107.3 million in 2012. Our combined selling and administrative expenses in 2013 were $41.6 million, a decrease of $5.6 million, or 11.9%, compared to $47.2 million in 2012. 

The following table presents our total revenue by segment, total operating costs and expenses, selling and administrative expenses and total operating earnings as a percent of total revenue for 2013 and 2012:

Our daily newspapers businesses experienced a 2.1% increase in retail advertising revenue in 2013 compared to 2012. Classified advertising revenue decreased 7.9% in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a $0.8 million decrease in employment advertising. Subscription revenue decreased $2.5 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily driven by an 8.2% decline in volume and $0.9 million of subscription revenue earned in the extra week in 2012. Other revenue, which primarily includes commercial printing and delivery revenue decreased $0.6 million or 3.2% in 2013 compared to 2012. The decrease was primarily driven by $0.3 million of revenue earned in the extra week in 2012, and commercial delivery declines of $0.5 million, partially offset by $0.5 million of revenue from one large commercial print customer.

Our community publications businesses experienced a 54.1% decrease in retail advertising revenue in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to a $5.3 million decline from the sale of the northern Wisconsin publications in December 2012. Classified advertising revenue decreased 33.3% in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to a decline of $0.7 million from the sale of the northern Wisconsin publications. Subscription revenue decreased $0.4 million in 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due a $0.3 million decline from the sale of the northern Wisconsin publications. Other revenue, which primarily includes commercial printing and delivery revenue increased $1.3 million or 33.3% in 2013 compared to 2012, driven by an increase of $1.8 million from the commercial printing of the Northern Wisconsin publications that we sold in 2012, but continued to print after the sale partially offset by reduced revenue from other customers.

The decrease in total operating costs and expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in employee, newsprint and paper costs. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in workforce reduction charges and the extra week. 

Our combined operating earnings were $10.6 million in 2013, an increase of $1.2 million, or 12.8%, compared to $9.4 million in 2012. The following table presents our operating earnings by segment for 2013 and 2012:  

---  
| | | | | | | |

Community Publications|  | 0.7|   
|  | 0.8|   

Total operating income|  | $| 10.6|   
|  | $| 9.4|   

The increase in total operating earnings was primarily due to lower production costs driven by reduced newsprint and paper costs in addition to reduced headcount.

EBITDA in 2013 was $17.7 million, a decrease of $0.9 million, or 4.8%, compared to $18.6 million in 2012. We define EBITDA as net income from continuing operations excluding provision for income taxes, total other expense, net (which is comprised of interest income and expense), depreciation and amortization. Management primarily uses EBITDA, among other things, to evaluate our operating performance compared to our operating plans and/or prior years and to value prospective acquisitions. We believe the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management, helps to improve their ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. EBITDA is also a primary measure used externally by our investors and our peers in our industry for purposes of valuation and comparing our operating performance to other companies in the industry. EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to EBITDA measures reported by other companies.

The following table presents a reconciliation of our combined net income from continuing operations to EBITDA for 2013 and 2012:

The decrease in our EBITDA was driven by lower revenue for the reasons described above, combined with higher outsourced freight expense to replace capitalized vehicles that were expensed through depreciation in 2012.

Revenue from our combined operations in 2013 was $153.3 million, a decrease of $10.6 million, or 6.5%, compared to $163.9 million in 2012. Operating earnings were $10.6 million in 2013, an increase of $1.2 million, or 12.8%, compared to $9.4 million in 2012.

Advertising revenue accounted for 53.2% of total revenue in 2013 compared to 55.0% in 2012. The ongoing secular changes in the newspaper industry and the current economic environment have caused advertisers to decrease their advertising spending. In addition, due to the changing mix of revenue categories, changes in frequency and placement of advertising in the newspaper and planned competitive advertising rate decreases in order to increase volume, we continued to see decreases in the average rate per inch of advertising in 2013.

Retail advertising revenue in 2013 was $64.1 million, a decrease of $6.1 million, or 8.7%, compared to $70.2 million in 2012. We continue to believe consumers are still cautious in regards to spending discretionary income and advertisers are still decreasing their spending in traditional print products. The $1.2 million increase in retail advertising revenue at our daily newspapers segment was primarily due to $2.5 million of revenue from several new large customers, partially offset by existing customers decreasing their spend on traditional print products. The $7.3 million decrease in retail advertising revenue at our community publications segment was primarily due to a $5.3 million decrease from the sale of our northern Wisconsin publications in December 2012.

Classified advertising is generally the most sensitive to economic cycles because it is driven by the demand of employment, automotive sales and real estate transactions. As a result of the ongoing secular trend of classified advertising transitioning to the Internet and the current economic environment, our businesses experienced a decrease in ROP classified advertising revenue in 2013 compared to 2012. Classified advertising revenue in 2013 was $14.7 million, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 12.0%, compared to $16.7 million in 2012 due to $0.9 million lower employment and automotive advertising at our daily newspaper and a $0.7 million decrease from the sale of our northern Wisconsin publications in December 2012.

The total decrease in retail and classified automotive advertising revenue at the daily newspaper in 2013 was $0.2 million, or 6.3%, primarily due to a decrease in classified digital advertising revenue.

Total retail and classified digital advertising revenue at the daily newspaper was $12.8 million in 2013, an increase of $0.5 million, or 3.7%, compared to $12.3 million in 2012. Digital retail advertising revenue increased 10.2% compared to 2012 due to a $0.6 million increase in sponsorships and a $0.2 million increase in other digital revenue. Digital classified advertising revenue decreased 12.4% compared to 2012 due to a $0.4 million decrease in classified upsells. Digital advertising revenue is reported in the retail and classified advertising revenue categories.

National advertising revenue was $2.7 million in 2013, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 18.2%, compared to $3.3 million in 2012. The decrease was primarily due to certain national campaigns that were not repeated in 2013.

Subscription revenue accounted for 32.0% of total revenue in 2013 compared to 31.7% in 2012. Subscription revenue was $49.0 million in 2013, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 5.6%, compared to $51.9 million in 2012 due to the extra week, $0.9 million, and an 8.2% decline in circulation volumes at our daily newspaper that offset price increases.

Other revenue, which consists of revenue from commercial printing, commercial distribution and promotional revenue, accounted for 14.9% of total revenue in 2013 compared to 13.3% in 2012. Other revenue was $22.8 million in 2013, an increase of $1.0 million, or 4.6%, compared to $21.8 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to increased commercial printing revenue an increase of $1.8 million from the commercial printing of the Northern Wisconsin publications that we sold in 2012, but continued to print after the sale, partially offset by a $0.6 million decline in commercial delivery revenue and the extra week of $0.3 million.

Operating income in 2013 was $10.6 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 12.8%, compared to $9.4 million in 2012. The increase in operating income was primarily due to decreased employee-related costs and depreciation expense. Total expenses decreased $11.8 million in 2013 as compared to 2012, primarily due to $7.7 million in expense savings from the sale of the northern Wisconsin community publications in December 2012, combined with $1.0 million in savings at the daily newspaper in employee costs, materials and depreciation. Total newsprint and paper costs were $15.5 million in 2013 compared to $16.9 million in 2012. There was a 7.1% decrease in newsprint consumption and a 2.6% decrease in average newsprint and paper pricing per metric ton.

Other Income and Expense and Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 40.2% in 2013 compared to 38.2% in 2012.

Other income and expenses primarily consists of interest expense on our related party payables. Interest expense in 2013 was $0.4 million compared to $0.3 million in 2012.

Net Income

Our net income in 2013 was $6.1 million, an increase of $0.5 million, or 8.9%, compared to $5.6 million in 2012. The increase was due to lower production costs driven by reduced newsprint and paper costs in addition to reduced headcount.

2012 (53 weeks) Compared to 2011 (52 weeks) 

2012 contained 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in 2011. Although it is difficult to precisely quantify the impact of the additional week, we estimate the revenue impact to be $2.8 million and the operating earnings impact to be $0.4 million.

Our combined revenue in 2012 was $163.9 million, a decrease of $3.3 million, or 2.0%, compared to $167.2 million in 2011. Our combined operating costs and expenses in 2012 were $107.3 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 0.6%, compared to $108.0 million in 2011. Our combined selling and administrative expenses in 2012 were $47.2 million, an increase of $0.6 million, or 1.3%, compared to $46.6 million in 2011.

Our daily newspaper business experienced a 0.2% decrease in retail advertising revenue in 2012 compared to 2011. The retail advertising revenue decrease was a result of decreases in the department store, telecommunications, and building categories, partially offset by the increase in retail ROP from special programs and initiatives. Classified advertising revenue decreased 16.7% in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to decreases in the automotive and employment categories. Partially offsetting these revenue decreases was a 2.4% increase in subscription revenue in 2012 compared to 2011. Subscription revenue increased $1.2 million in 2012 compared to 2011. Commercial delivery revenue decreased in 2012 by $0.1 million compared to 2011. Commercial printing revenue increased $0.9 million in 2012 compared to 2011, driven by $0.3 million increased volume in the extra week and $0.2 million from one large new customer.

Our community publications business experienced a $1.0 million, or 6.9%, decrease in retail advertising revenue in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to the sale of the northern Wisconsin publications in December 2012. Classified advertising revenue decreased $0.7 million, or 20.6%, in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to continued softness in the classified categories. 

Operating costs and expenses in 2012 decreased $0.7 million compared to 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in newsprint and paper costs, a decrease in employee costs and lower cost of sales caused by volume decline. The $0.6 million increase in selling and administrative expenses in 2012 compared to 2011 was primarily due to impairment of long-lived assets of $0.2 million and workforce reduction charges of $1.6 million in 2012 compared to $1.3 million in 2011.

Our combined operating earnings were $9.4 million in 2012, a decrease of $3.2 million, or 25.4%, compared to $12.6 million in 2011. The following table presents our operating earnings by segment for 2012 and 2011:

The decrease in total operating earnings was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in advertising revenue. 

EBITDA in 2012 was $18.6 million, a decrease of $4.4 million, or 19.1%, compared to $23.0 million in 2011.

Included in net income from continuing operations for 2011 are workforce reductions charges of $1.7 million.  

The decrease in our EBITDA was consistent with the decrease in our operating income for the reasons described above.

Revenue from our combined operations in 2012 was $163.9 million, a decrease of $3.3 million, or 2.0%, compared to $167.2 million in 2011. Operating earnings were $9.4 million in 2012, a decrease of $3.1 million, or 24.6%, compared to $12.6 million in 2011.

Advertising revenue accounted for 55.0% of total revenue in 2012 compared to 57.4% in 2011. The ongoing secular changes in the newspaper industry and the current economic environment have caused advertisers to decrease their advertising spending across most of our advertising revenue categories. In addition, due to the changing mix of revenue categories, changes in frequency and placement of advertising in the newspaper and planned advertising rate decreases in order to increase volume, we continued to see decreases in the average rate per inch of advertising in 2012.

Retail advertising revenue in 2012 was $70.2 million, a decrease of $1.1 million, or 1.5%, compared to $71.3 million in 2011. We continue to believe consumers are still cautious in regards to spending discretionary income and advertisers are still decreasing their spending in traditional print products, including the daily newspaper. These trends persisted in our community publications business. The $1.0 million or 6.9% decrease in retail advertising revenue at our community publications business was primarily due to the sale of our northern Wisconsin community publications in the fourth quarter of 2012.

Classified advertising is generally the most sensitive to economic cycles because it is driven by the demand of employment, automotive sales and real estate transactions. As a result of the ongoing secular trend of classified advertising transitioning to the Internet and the current economic environment, our businesses experienced a decrease in ROP classified advertising revenue in 2012 compared to 2011. Classified advertising revenue in 2012 was $16.7 million, a decrease of $3.5 million, or 17.3%, compared to $20.2 million in 2011. At the daily newspaper, classified advertising revenue decreased $2.8 million, or 16.7%, in 2012 compared 

F- 111

<a name="sB4A4CB389C4291DFC04550CF9E489BAC"></a>

to 2011. The revenue decreases were led by the employment and automotive categories, which in the aggregate decreased $2.2 million, or 25.8%. At our community publications business, classified advertising revenue decreased $0.7 million, or 20.6%, in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to continued softness in the classified categories.

The total decrease in retail and classified automotive advertising revenue at the daily newspaper in 2012 was $0.6 million, or 13.5%, compared to 2011 primarily due to a decrease in classified ROP advertising revenue of $1.1 million, partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in retail ROP advertising revenue.

Total retail and classified digital advertising revenue at the daily newspaper was $12.3 million in 2012, an increase of $1.0 million, or 9.3%, compared to $11.3 million in 2012. Digital retail advertising revenue increased 26.1% compared to 2011 due to a $1.5 million increase in sponsorship revenue and other digital revenue. Digital classified advertising revenue decreased 17.7% compared to 2011 due to decreases in classified upsell revenue of $0.2 million and classified package revenue of $0.6 million. Digital advertising revenue is reported in the retail and classified advertising revenue categories.

National advertising revenue was $3.3 million in 2012, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 26.7%, compared to $4.5 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in ROP and preprint advertising in the furniture and business services categories.

Subscription revenue accounted for 31.7% of total revenue in 2012 compared to 30.3% in 2011. Subscription revenue was $51.9 million in 2012, an increase of $1.2 million, or 2.4%, compared to $50.7 million in 2011. The $1.2 million increase at the daily newspaper was primarily due to $0.9 million earned in the extra week. At our community publications business, subscription revenue remained consistent at $1.7 million in 2012 and 2011.

Other revenue, which consists of revenue from commercial printing, commercial distribution and promotional revenue at the daily newspaper and commercial printing at the printing plant of our community publications, accounted for 13.3% of total publishing revenue in 2012 compared to 12.3% in 2011. Other revenue was $21.8 million in 2012, an increase of $1.3 million, or 6.3%, compared to $20.5 million in 2011. The $1.3 million increase at the daily newspaper was primarily due to an increase in commercial printing revenue of $0.9 million driven by increased volume in the extra week and $0.2 million from one large new customer. At our community publications business, other revenue was $3.9 million in 2012, an increase of $0.3 million, or 8.3%, compared to $3.6 million in 2011.

Operating income in 2012 was $9.4 million, a decrease of $3.2 million, or 25.4%, compared to $12.6 million in 2011. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in advertising revenue. In an effort to partially offset the impact of the decrease in advertising revenue, our businesses continue to reduce their expense platforms. Total operating expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 0.6%, in 2012 compared to 2011, primarily due to a decrease in employee related costs and a decrease in costs due to revenue declines. Total newsprint and paper costs in 2012 were $16.9 million, an increase of $0.1 million, or 0.6%, compared to $16.8 million in 2011 due to a 0.4% increase in average newsprint pricing per metric ton, partially offset by a 0.2% decrease in newsprint consumption. Total selling and administrative expenses were $47.2 million in 2012, an increase of $0.6 million, or 1.3%, compared to $46.6 million in 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in workforce reduction charges.

Other Income and Expense and Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 38.2% in 2012 compared to 37.6% in 2011.

Other income and expenses primarily consists of interest expense on our related party payables. Interest expense in 2012 was $0.3 million compared to $0.4 million in 2011.

Discontinued Operations

JRN Newspapers’ results of operations for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2011 and its financial position at December 25, 2011 reflect the Florida-based businesses as discontinued operations. Revenue and earnings before income taxes as reported in earnings discontinued operations in 2011 were $2.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

In June 2011, Journal Community Publishing Group, Inc., JRN Newspapers’ community newspapers and shoppers business, completed the sale of the Pelican Press and Pelican Press Marketplace businesses, which operated in Sarasota, Florida. In August 2011, Journal Community Publishing Group, Inc. completed the sale of the remaining Florida-based community newspapers and shoppers businesses. The publications and websites included Florida Mariner, Clay Today, Clay County Leader, Ponte Vedra Recorder, St. Augustine Underground, First Coast Register and Car Connection, and were distributed in the Clay, St. John’s and Duval, Florida counties.

Net Income

Our net income in 2012 was $5.6 million, a decrease of $2.4 million, or 30.0%, compared to $8.0 million in 2011. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of the decrease in advertising revenue and the other reasons described above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, Journal provided capital, cash management and other treasury services to JRN Newspapers. Journal will continue to provide these services to JRN Newspapers until the Transactions are consummated. As part of these services, a majority of the cash balances are swept from JRN Newspapers to Journal on a daily basis. Following the Transactions, JRN Newspapers will no longer participate in capital management with Journal and JRN Newspapers’ ability to fund its future cash needs will depend on its ongoing ability to generate and raise cash in the future. JRN Newspapers believes that its future cash from operations will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for the foreseeable future. We expect to selectively invest resources in digital initiatives, our brands, employees, products and capital projects.

Acquisitions and Sales

On December 3, 2012, Journal Community Publishing Group, Inc., our community publications business, completed the sale of Hodag Buyers’ Guide, North Star Journal, Merrill Foto News, Wausau Buyers’ Guide, Stevens Point Buyers’ Guide, Wood County Buyers’ Guide, Waupaca Buyers’ Guide, Waupaca County Post East, Waupaca County Post West, Clintonville Shoppers’ Guide, New London Buyers’ Guide, Silent Sports, Waupacanow.com, Merrillfotonews.com, Starjournalnow.com, Silentsports.net, Wibuyersguide.com and a single copy distribution network based in Rhinelander, WI for $1.2 million in cash and a $0.8 million note receivable. We recorded a pre-tax loss on the sale, net of transaction expenses, of $0.2 million. Management concluded the Northern WI publications should not be classified as a discontinued operation.

Based upon the guidance in ASC 250-20-55, management concluded the Northern WI publications should not be classified as a discontinued operation, since the ongoing Journal Community Publishing Group, Inc. entity expects to generate continuing cash flows resulting from activities with the divested operations and Journal Community Publishing Group, Inc. will have significant continuing involvement in the divested businesses. We continue to print and record commercial print revenue for these titles.

In 2011, Journal Community Publishing Group, Inc. completed the sale of several Florida-based community newspapers and shoppers businesses, discussed further in the “Discontinued Operations” section above.

Cash provided by operating activities was $14.6 million, $14.2 million, and $14.7 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities from 2011 to 2012 was due to lower net income and changes in net working capital. The increase in cash provided by operating activities from 2012 to 2013 was due to higher net income and changes in net working capital.

Cash provided by (used for) investing activities was $(2.4) million, $1.3 million, and $0.5 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Changes in cash provided by (used for) investing activities year over year were due to changes in proceeds from sale of assets and businesses, which were $0.0 million, $2.4 million, and $1.5 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. In 2012, we sold the majority of our northern Wisconsin community publications business. Cash provided by these sales were offset by changes in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $(2.5) million, $(1.1) million, and $(1.0) million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. We believe the increase in capital expenditures will help us to better serve our advertisers and readers and will facilitate our cost control initiatives.

Cash (used for) financing activities was $(12.0) million, $(15.8) million, and $(15.3) million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. Changes year over year were primarily driven by transactions with Journal, which are discussed in the “Related Party Transactions and Party Company Investment” footnote of the combined financial statements and the notes thereto included in this joint proxy statement/prospectus.

(1)| For the postretirement benefits, payments included in the table have been actuarially estimated over a ten-year period. While benefit payments under these benefit plans are expected to continue beyond 2022, we believe that an estimate beyond this period is unreasonable.

(2)| Other liabilities consist primarily of obligations for capital leases, worker’s compensation claims and employee severance.   

As of December 29, 2013, we expect to make payments over a ten-year period for the non-qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefit plan of $1.0 million and $10.4 million, respectively.

We lease office space, distribution centers, buildings used for printing plants and equipment under both short-term and long-term leases accounted for as operating leases. Some of the lease agreements contain renewal options and rental escalation clauses, as well as provisions for the payment of utilities, maintenance and taxes.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We do not engage in off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that may have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or significant components of revenues or expenses. We do not rely on off-balance sheet arrangements for liquidity, capital resources, market risk support, credit risk support or other benefits.

Critical Accounting Policies

JRN Newspapers’ significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the audited combined financial statements. Our management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our combined financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related footnote disclosures. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to doubtful accounts, property and equipment, intangible assets, income taxes, litigation, and pension and other postretirement benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We do not believe our past results have differed materially from these estimates; however, we cannot predict how actual results may differ from these estimates in the future.

We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our combined financial statements.

Revenue recognition-JRN Newspapers’ principal sources of revenue are the sale of advertising in newspapers and the sale of newspapers to individual subscribers and distributors. In addition, JRN Newspapers sells advertising on its newspaper websites and derives revenue from other online activities. Advertising revenue is recognized in the publishing businesses when advertisements are published or displayed, or when related advertising services are rendered. Newspaper advertising contracts, which generally have a term of one year or less, may provide discounts based upon the volume of advertising purchased during the terms of the contracts. Estimated discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the period the advertisement is displayed. This requires management to make certain estimates regarding future advertising volumes. Estimates are based on various factors including historical experience and advertising sales trends. These estimates are revised as necessary based on actual volumes realized. Subscription revenue is recognized on a pro-rata basis over the term of the newspaper subscription or when the newspaper is delivered to the customer. Amounts JRN Newspapers receives from customers in advance of revenue recognition are deferred as liabilities. Deferred revenue to be earned more than one year from the balance sheet date is included in other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

Printing revenue from external customers as well as third-party distribution revenue is recognized when the product is delivered in accordance with the customers’ instructions.

Goodwill and other intangible assets-JRN Newspapers amortizes definite-lived intangible assets, which historically consisted of customer lists, non-compete agreements, tradenames, franchise fees and patents and trademarks, on a straight-line basis over periods of five to 25 years. The costs incurred to renew or extend the term of certain customer relationships are expensed as incurred. 

Indefinite-lived intangible assets, which consists of only goodwill, are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other.” The fair value measurements determined for purposes of performing our impairment tests are considered level 3 under the fair value hierarchy because they require significant unobservable inputs to be developed using estimates and assumptions which we determine and reflect those that a market participant would use. Under ASC Topic 350, the impairment review of goodwill must be based on estimated fair values. 

JRN Newspapers’ annual impairment review measurement date is the first day of the fourth quarter of each year. The estimated fair value of goodwill is determined using many critical factors, including projected future operating cash flows, revenue and market growth, market multiples, discount rates and consideration of market valuations of comparable companies. The estimated 

F- 115

* * *

<a name="sB4A4CB389C4291DFC04550CF9E489BAC"></a>

fair values of other intangible assets subject to the annual impairment review are calculated based on projected future discounted cash flow analyses. The development of estimated fair values requires the use of assumptions, including assumptions regarding revenue and market growth, as well as specific economic factors in the publishing industry, such as operating margins. These assumptions reflect JRN Newspapers’ best estimates, but these items involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of JRN Newspapers’ control.

Adverse changes in expected operating results and/or unfavorable changes in other economic factors used to estimate fair values could result in non-cash impairment charges in the future under ASC Topic 350.

Impairment of long-lived assets-In accordance with ASC Topic 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment,” property and equipment and other definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is considered impaired when the projected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the asset or asset group over its remaining depreciable life are less than its current carrying value. If an asset is considered impaired, a charge is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset or group of assets. Fair value is measured by considering sale prices for similar assets or by discounting projected future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. Such analyses necessarily involve significant judgment and, accordingly, actual results could vary significantly from such estimates.

Defined benefit plan-Retirement benefits are provided to eligible employees of Journal and JRN Newspapers through a defined benefit pension plan sponsored by Journal. The plan provides benefits based on years of service and the average compensation for the employee’s last five years of employment. Plan assets consist primarily of listed stocks and government and other bonds. It is Journal’s policy to fund the minimum for its defined benefit pension plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”).

Retirement benefit obligations pursuant to the Journal-sponsored defined benefit pension plan have historically been, and will continue to be, an obligation of Journal. Therefore, JRN Newspapers elected to account for costs associated with this defined benefit pension plan using accounting guidance for multiemployer plans in accordance with ASC Topic 715, “Compensation-Retirement Benefits.” ASC Topic 715 provides that an employer which participates in a multiemployer defined benefit plan is not required to report a liability beyond the contributions currently due and unpaid to the plan. As no such amounts are due and unpaid by JRN Newspapers, no assets or liabilities related to the obligations under the Journal-sponsored defined benefit pension plan have been included in the combined balance sheets.

It is anticipated that Scripps will become the successor plan sponsor of Journal’s defined benefit pension plan in conjunction with the Broadcast Merger. It is expected Scripps will maintain, administer and fund the plan. Therefore, on the date of the spin-off, JRN Newspapers will not assume any asset or liability associated with the defined benefit plan.

Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan-Journal sponsors an unfunded non-qualified pension plan for certain employees whose benefits under the pension plan and 401(k) plan may be restricted due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. The unfunded non-qualified pension plan was permanently frozen effective January 1, 2011. The expected cost of providing these benefits is accrued over the years that the employees render services. It is Journal’s policy to fund its unfunded non-qualified pension plan as payments are made.

Journal recognizes the underfunded status of its unfunded non-qualified plan as a liability in its consolidated balance sheets and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income (loss). The portions of the liabilities for the unfunded non-qualified pension plan, net periodic benefit costs and other comprehensive income (loss) related to JRN Newspapers have been allocated to JRN Newspapers and presented within these combined financial statements. The amounts included within these combined financial statements were actuarially determined based on amounts allocable to eligible JRN Newspapers employees.

Postretirement health benefits-Journal also provides certain postretirement health benefits for certain retired employees and their spouses, and certain active employees who were age 50 by December 31, 2006. The expected cost of providing these benefits is accrued over the years that the employees render services. It is Journal’s policy to fund postretirement benefits as claims are incurred.

Journal recognizes the underfunded status of its postretirement health benefit plans as a liability in its consolidated balance sheets and recognizes changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income (loss). The portions of the liabilities for postretirement health benefits, net periodic benefit costs and other comprehensive income (loss) related to JRN Newspapers have been allocated to JRN Newspapers and presented within these combined financial statements. The amounts included within these combined financial statements were actuarially determined based on amounts allocable to eligible JRN

Newspapers employees.

Income taxes-Deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

Journal recognizes an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities and we measure the tax benefit as the largest amount of benefit, determined on a cumulative basis, which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement.

New accounting standards

In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issue ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 105-40) ("ASU 2014-15"). The new standard requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern for both annual and interim reporting periods. The provisions of ASU 2014-15 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter; early adoption is permitted. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the combined financial statements.

In May 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on revenue recognition. Under this new standard, an entity shall recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard creates a five-step process that requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of the contract(s) and all relevant facts and circumstances. This standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method and will be effective for us beginning in 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. We are currently assessing the impact this new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined a transition method.

In April 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08 (ASU 2014-08) "Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity." ASU 2014-08 raises the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation and requires new disclosures of both discontinued operations and certain other disposals that do not meet the definition of a discontinued operation. It is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. Early adoption is permitted but only for disposals that have not been reported in financial statements previously issued. We adopted this guidance in the third quarter of 2014. The adoption of this guidance did not impact JRN Newspapers’ combined financial statements.

In July 2013, the FASB issued guidance related to the presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward, similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward exists. The new guidance clarifies that companies should present an unrecognized tax benefit as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013, with early adoption permitted. JRN Newspapers adopted this guidance in 2013. The adoption of this guidance did not impact JRN Newspapers’ combined financial statements.

In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance related to items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income. The new guidance requires either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements: (i) the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and (ii) the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning January 1, 2013 with early adoption permitted. JRN Newspapers adopted this guidance in 2013. The adoption of this guidance did not impact JRN Newspapers’ combined financial statements.

Effect of Inflation

Our results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by general inflation. We have reduced the effects of rising costs through improvements in productivity, cost containment programs and, where the competitive environment permits, increased selling prices. However, changes in newsprint prices could have an adverse impact on costs, which we may not be able to offset fully in our pricing or cost containment programs.

In the three quarters of 2014, our combined revenue was down $2.9 million due to declines in advertising and subscription revenue. Total advertising revenue was $56.5 million in the three quarters of 2014 and $58.5 million in the three quarters of 2013. Retail advertising revenue decreased $1.2 million in the three quarters of 2014 compared to the three quarters of 2013, primarily due to a $0.9 million decrease in advertising from one large customer at the daily newspaper and $0.3 million in reduced spending from the healthcare segment. Classified advertising revenue decreased in the three quarters of 2014 by $0.6 million compared to the three quarters of 2013, primarily due to $0.4 million declines in both the employment and real estate and rentals categories. Publishing digital advertising revenue of $9.6 million increased 3.0%, primarily due to an increase of $0.4 million in digital retail sponsorships and $0.1 million in other revenue, partially offset by a $0.2 million decline in classified digital advertising revenue. National advertising revenue decreased $0.2 million in the three quarters of 2014 due to a decline in preprints. Subscription revenue at our daily newspaper decreased $0.6 million in the three quarters of 2014 compared to the three quarters of 2013 primarily due to a decline in circulation volume. Commercial distribution revenue was essentially flat compared to the three quarters of 2013. Commercial print revenue decreased $0.3 million in the three quarters of 2014 compared to the three quarters of 2013.

Total expenses decreased $3.4 million in the three quarters of 2014 compared to the three quarters of 2013. The $2.8 million decrease in total operating costs and expenses in the three quarters of 2014 compared to the three quarters of 2013 was primarily due to expense savings of $0.9 million in newsprint and $0.5 million in carrier deliver expenses. Selling and administrative expenses decreased $0.6 million, or 1.9%, in the three quarters of 2014 compared to the three quarters of 2013. 

Our combined operating income was $5.2 million in the three quarters of 2014, an increase of $0.5 million, or 10.6%, compared to $4.7 million in the three quarters of 2013. The following table presents our operating income by segment for the three quarters of 2014 and the three quarters of 2013:

The increase in total operating income was due to decreased operating costs and decreased selling and administrative expenses partially offset by declines in advertising and subscription revenue.

EBITDA in the three quarters of 2014 was $10.1 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 2.0%, compared to $9.9 million in the three quarters of 2013. We define EBITDA as net income from continuing operations excluding provision for income taxes, total other expense, net (which is comprised of interest income and expense), depreciation and amortization. Management primarily uses EBITDA, among other things, to evaluate our operating performance compared to our operating plans and/or prior years and to value prospective acquisitions. We believe the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management, helps to improve their ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different financing and capital structures or tax rates. EBITDA is also a primary measure used externally by our investors and our peers in our industry for purposes of valuation and comparing our operating performance to other companies in the industry. EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. EBITDA should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, net income as an indicator of operating performance or cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to EBITDA measures reported by other companies.

The following table presents a reconciliation of our combined net income from continuing operations to EBITDA for the three quarters of 2014 and the three quarters of 2013:

(1) Included in net income for the three quarters of 2014 are workforce reduction charges of $0.8 million. Included in net income from continuing operations for the three quarters of 2013 are workforce reduction charges of $0.7 million.

The increase in our EBITDA was consistent with the increase in our operating income for the reasons described above.

Revenue from our combined operations in the three quarters of 2014 was $108.9 million, a decrease of $2.9 million, or 2.6%, compared to $111.8 million in the three quarters of 2013. Operating income from our combined operations were $5.2 million in the three quarters of 2014, an increase of $0.5 million, or 10.6%, compared to $4.7 million in the three quarters of 2013.

Advertising revenue accounted for 51.9% of total revenue in the three quarters of 2014 and 52.3% of the total revenue in the three quarters of 2013. Retail advertising revenue in the three quarters of 2014 was $44.3 million, a decrease of $1.2 million, or 2.6%, compared to $45.5 million in the three quarters of 2013, primarily due to retail advertising revenue decreases at our daily newspaper. At our daily newspaper, retail advertising revenue decreased $1.4 million in the three quarters of 2014 compared to the three quarters of 2013, due to a $0.9 million decrease in advertising from one large customer at the daily newspaper and $0.3 million in reduced spending from the healthcare segment. In addition, due to the changing mix of revenue categories, changes in frequency and placement of advertising in the newspaper and planned competitive advertising rate decreases in order to increase volume, we continued to see decreases in the average rate per inch of advertising in 2014. The $0.2 million increase in retail advertising revenue at our community newspapers business was due to increased gains in ROP advertising.

Classified advertising is generally the most sensitive to economic cycles because it is driven by the employment demand, automotive sales and real estate transactions. As a result of the ongoing secular trend of classified advertising transitioning to the internet and the current economic environment, we experienced a decrease in ROP classified advertising revenue in the three quarters of 2014 compared to the three quarters of 2013. Classified advertising revenue in the three quarters of 2014 was $10.6 million, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 5.4%, compared to $11.2 million in the three quarters of 2013. At our daily newspaper, classified advertising revenue decreased $0.6 million, or 6.1%, in the three quarters of 2014 compared to the three quarters of 2013. At our community newspapers business, classified advertising revenue remained consistent at $1.4 million in the three quarters of 2014 and $1.4 million in the three quarters of 2013. 

Total retail and classified digital advertising revenue at our daily newspaper was $9.4 million in the three quarters of 2014 and $9.2 million in the three quarters of 2013. Digital retail advertising revenue increased 6.9% compared to the three quarters of 2013, primarily due to increases of $0.4 million in retail sponsorships and $0.1 million in other digital revenue. Digital classified advertising revenue decreased 8.2% compared to the three quarters of 2013 due to a decrease in employment related advertising. Digital advertising revenue is reported in the retail and classified advertising revenue categories.

National advertising revenue was $1.6 million in the three quarters of 2014, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 11.1%, compared to $1.8 million in the three quarters of 2013. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in preprint revenue.

Subscription revenue was $35.6 million in the three quarters of 2014, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 1.9%, compared to $36.3 million in the three quarters of 2013. At our daily newspaper, subscription revenue of $34.7 million in the three quarters of 2014 decreased $0.6 million compared to $35.3 million in the three quarters of 2013, primarily due to a decline in circulation volume. Subscription revenue decrease at the daily newspaper was driven by an 8.3% decline in home delivery and single copy volume, partially offset by a 7.5% increase in the average rate. At our community newspapers business, subscription revenue decreased $0.1 million in the three quarters of 2014 compared to the three quarters of 2013.

Other revenue, which consists of revenue from commercial printing, commercial distribution and promotional revenue at our daily newspaper and commercial printing at our community newspapers, accounted for 15.4% of total revenue in the three quarters of 2014 compared to 15.2% in the three quarters of 2013. Other revenue was $16.8 million in the three quarters of 2014, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 1.2%, compared to $17.0 million in the three quarters of 2013, primarily due to a decrease of $0.3 million in commercial printing revenue at the daily newspaper.

Operating income in the three quarters of 2014 was $5.2 million, an increase of $0.5 million, or 10.6%, compared to $4.7 million in the three quarters of 2013. The increase in operating income was primarily due to decreased operating costs and decreased selling and administrative expenses partially offset by declines in advertising and subscription revenue. Total expenses decreased $3.4 million the three quarters of 2014 as compared to the three quarters of 2013, primarily due to expense savings in materials, payroll and delivery expenses. Total newsprint and paper costs were $10.7 million in the three quarters of 2014 compared to $11.6 million in the three quarters of 2013. There was a 6.0% decrease in newsprint consumption and a 1.8% decrease in average newsprint and paper pricing per metric ton.

Other Income and Expense and Taxes

Our effective tax rate was 38.2% in the three quarters of 2014 compared to 40.2% in the three quarters of 2013.

Other income and expenses primarily consists of interest expense on our related party payables. Interest expense in the three quarters of 2014 was $0.1 million compared to $0.3 million in the three quarters of 2013.

Net Income

Our net income in the three quarters of 2014 was $3.1 million, an increase of $0.5 million, or 19.2%, compared to $2.6 million in the three quarters of 2013. The increase was due to increased operating earnings for the reasons described above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Historically, Journal provided capital, cash management and other treasury services to JRN Newspapers. Journal will continue to provide these services to JRN Newspapers until the Transactions are consummated. As part of these services, a majority of the cash balances are swept from JRN Newspapers to Journal on a daily basis. Following the Transactions, JRN Newspapers will no longer participate in capital management with Journal and JRN Newspapers’ ability to fund its future cash needs will depend on its ongoing ability to generate and raise cash in the future. JRN Newspapers believes that its future cash from operations will provide adequate resources to fund its operating and financing needs for the foreseeable future. We expect to selectively invest resources in digital initiatives, our brands, employees, products and capital projects.

Workforce Reductions and Business Improvements

Our liability for separation benefits of $0.6 million as of September 28, 2014 will be paid by the third quarter of 2015. The ongoing activity of our liability for separation benefits during the three quarters ended September 28, 2014 and year ended December 29, 2013 were as follows:

Cash provided by operating activities was $10.5 million and $11.4 million in the three quarters ended September 28, 2014 and September 29, 2013, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was due to changes in working capital partially offset by higher net income.

Cash (used for) investing activities was $(0.4) million and $(2.1) million in the three quarters ended September 28, 2014 and September 29, 2013, respectively. Changes in cash (used for) investing activities year over year were due to changes in capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $(0.4) million and $(2.2) million in the three quarters ended September 28, 2014 and September 29, 2013 respectively.

Cash (used for) financing activities was $(10.5) million and $(9.1) million in the three quarters ended September 28, 2014 and September 29, 2013, respectively. Changes year over year were primarily driven by transactions with Journal, which are discussed in the “Related Party Transactions and Party Company Investment” footnote of the combined financial statements and the notes thereto included in this information statement.

(a) If and to the extent that the valid, complete and perfected transfer or assignment to the Scripps Newspaper Entities of any Scripps Newspaper Assets or to Scripps or the Scripps Broadcast Entities of any Scripps Broadcast Assets as contemplated by Section 2.03 would be a violation of Applicable Law or require any Consent or Governmental Approval, then the applicable transfer or assignment shall be automatically deemed deferred and any such purported transfer or assignment shall be null and void until such time as all legal impediments are removed and/or such Consents or Governmental Approvals have been obtained.

Section 6.02 Newspaper Mergers Exchange Procedures.

(a) At or prior to the Newspaper Merger Effective Time, Newco shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Scripps Spinco Common Stock and Journal Spinco Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this Article 6, through the Exchange Agent, the shares of Newco Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 6.01(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Scripps Spinco Common Stock and Journal Spinco Common Stock.

<a name="sE82917BE6E69D13B33F550CFC0771B18"></a>

Shares of Newco Common Stock shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested or is otherwise required by Applicable Law.

Section 6.03 Payment of Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration; Surrender; Closing of Books.

(a) At or prior to the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, Scripps shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Exchange Agent, Scripps Class A Common Shares in an aggregate amount equal to the number of shares of Journal Common Stock then issued and outstanding multiplied by the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration (the “Broadcast Merger Fund”). Scripps shall bear all fees of the Exchange Agent payable on the Closing Date.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, but in no event more than one (1) Business Day following the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, Scripps shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of shares of Journal Common Stock that have converted into the right to receive Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form approved by Scripps and Journal and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates or delivery of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates or delivery of the Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration.

(c) Upon (i) surrender to the Exchange Agent of Certificates for cancellation, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions or (ii) compliance with the reasonable procedures established by Scripps and the Exchange Agent for delivery of Uncertificated Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration, and the Certificates so surrendered and Uncertificated Shares so delivered shall forthwith be canceled. Scripps Class A Common Shares issued as Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested or is otherwise required by Applicable Law.

(d) In the event any Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificates so surrendered or the Uncertificated Shares so delivered are registered, it shall be a condition to such payment of the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration in respect thereof that such Certificates shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Shares shall be properly delivered for transfer and, in each case, the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration in respect thereof or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Scripps that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered or delivered, as the case may be, as contemplated by this Section 6.03, each Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at all times after the Broadcast Merger Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender or delivery, the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration plus any dividend or other distribution declared and paid on the Scripps Class A Common Shares following the Broadcast Merger Effective Time. Any Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration paid or payable upon the surrender of any Certificate or the delivery of any Uncertificated Share shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Certificate or Uncertificated Share and the shares formerly represented thereby.

(e) At the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Journal shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Journal Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Broadcast Merger Effective Time thereafter on the records of Journal. If, after the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, any Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to Scripps or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be marked canceled (“Canceled Securities”) and exchanged as provided in and in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article 6.

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and an indemnity agreement by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of an indemnity bond and payment of a handling fee, all as may be required by Scripps in its discretion or as may be required by the Exchange Agent under the Exchange Agent Agreement, the Exchange Agent will be instructed to accept such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in exchange for the right to receive the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration. Delivery of such affidavit and indemnity agreement and the posting of such bond, together with any other deliverable Scripps or the Exchange Agent may require, shall be deemed delivery of a Certificate with respect to the relevant shares of Journal Common Stock for purposes of this Article 6.

(g) Any portion of the Broadcast Merger Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares or holders of Canceled Securities and other eligible Persons in accordance with this Article 6 for twelve (12) months after the Broadcast Merger Effective Time shall be delivered to Scripps upon demand, and any such holder who

<a name="sE82917BE6E69D13B33F550CFC0771B18"></a>

has not previously complied with this Article 6 shall thereafter look only to Scripps, and Scripps shall remain liable, for payment of any such holder’s claim to the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration due to such holder. Any portion of the Broadcast Merger Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares or holders of Canceled Securities as of a date which is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, become the property of Scripps free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of Scripps or the Exchange Agent or any of their respective Affiliates shall be liable to any record or beneficial owner of any such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or holders of Canceled Securities for any such Canceled Securities, or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Law.

Section 6.04 Fractional Shares.

(a) Newspaper Mergers. No fractional shares of Newco Common Stock shall be distributed to holders of shares of Scripps Spinco Common Stock or Journal Spinco Common Stock in the Newspaper Mergers. All fractional shares of Newco Common Stock that a holder of shares of Scripps Spinco Common Stock or Journal Spinco Common Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Newspaper Mergers shall be aggregated, and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, in lieu of receiving such fractional share, a shareholder will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.04(a), a cash payment representing such shareholder’s proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions (which sale transactions shall be made at such times, in such manner and on such terms as the Exchange Agent shall determine in its reasonable discretion) on behalf of all such shareholders of the aggregate of the fractional shares of Newco Common Stock which otherwise would have been distributed to such shareholders (the “Excess Newco Shares”). The sale of the Excess Newco Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE, the NASDAQ Stock Market or other nationally recognized stock exchange in the United States and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to such shareholders, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such shareholders. Newco shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other reasonable out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the reasonable expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Newco Shares. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to such shareholders in lieu of any fractional shares of Newco Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such shareholders without interest.

(b) Broadcast Merger. No fractional Scripps Class A Common Shares shall be distributed to Journal Shareholders in the Broadcast Merger. All fractional Scripps Class A Common Shares that a Journal Shareholder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to the Broadcast Merger shall be aggregated, and if a fractional share results from such aggregation, in lieu of receiving such fractional share, such shareholder will be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent and in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.04(b), a cash payment representing such shareholder’s proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions (which sale transactions shall be made at such times, in such manner and on such terms as the Exchange Agent shall determine in its reasonable discretion) on behalf of all such shareholders of the aggregate of the fractional Scripps Class A Common Shares which otherwise would have been issued to such shareholders (the “Excess Scripps Class A Common Shares”). The sale of the Excess Scripps Class A Common Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to such shareholders, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such shareholders. Scripps shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other reasonable out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the reasonable expenses and compensation of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such sale of the Excess Scripps Class A Common Shares. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to such shareholders in lieu of any fractional Scripps Class A Common Shares, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts to such shareholders without interest.

Section 6.05 Dissenting Shares (Broadcast Merger). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Journal Common Stock that are outstanding immediately prior to the Broadcast Merger Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, payment of the fair value of such shares of Journal Common Stock pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Sections 180.1301 through 180.1331 of the WBCL (such Shares, “Dissenting Shares”) shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration as provided in Section 6.01(b), but rather, the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only to payment of the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Sections 180.1301 through 180.1331 of the WBCL (and, at the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have any right with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with Sections 180.1301 through 180.1331 of the WBCL and any declared but unpaid dividends having a record date prior to the Broadcast Merger Effective Time); provided that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the dissenters’ rights under Sections 180.1301 through 180.1331 of the

WBCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder’s Dissenting Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Broadcast Merger Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to receive the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration (without interest thereon, but including any dividend or other distribution declared and paid on the Scripps Class A Common Shares following the Broadcast Merger Effective Time) as provided in Section 6.01(b). Journal shall notify Scripps as promptly as reasonably practicable of any demands received by Journal for payment of the fair value of any shares of Journal Common Stock, and Scripps shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, Journal shall not, without the prior written consent of Scripps (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any portion of the Per Share Broadcast Merger Consideration held in the Broadcast Merger Fund in respect of share consideration or other payments made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 6.03(a) or otherwise to pay for Dissenting Shares shall be returned to Scripps upon demand.

Section 6.06 Withholding Rights. Each of Scripps, Journal and the Exchange Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under applicable Tax law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

(i) to engage in discussions and negotiations with, and furnish information to, any Third Party in response to a Scripps Acquisition Proposal by any such Third Party (a “Scripps Bidder”) if, and only to the extent that, (A) such Scripps Acquisition Proposal did not result from a breach of the provisions of this Section 9.02 by Scripps or any of its Subsidiaries; (B) the Scripps Board concludes in good faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with a nationally recognized financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Scripps Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Scripps Superior Proposal; (C) the Scripps Board concludes in good faith, based on the information then available and after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law; (D) prior to providing any information or data to any such Scripps Bidder or entering into any discussions or negotiations with any such Scripps Bidder, Scripps promptly notifies Journal of (1) its intent to so furnish information or enter into discussions and negotiations with such Scripps Bidder, (2) the name of such Scripps Bidder and (3) a summary of the material terms and conditions of any such Scripps Acquisition Proposal, (E) prior to providing any information or data to any such Scripps Bidder, Scripps receives from such Scripps Bidder an executed confidentiality agreement, the terms of which are no less favorable to Scripps, in any material respect, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (F) Scripps promptly provides or makes available to Journal any non-public information concerning Scripps or its Subsidiaries provided or made available to such Scripps Bidder that was not previously provided or made available to Journal;

(iii) to comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Scripps Acquisition Proposal or make any disclosure to Scripps’s shareholders required by Applicable Law; provided, that the Scripps Board shall not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Journal the Scripps Board Recommendation except as permitted under subsection (ii) above. For the avoidance of doubt, a “stop, look and listen” or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any Scripps Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Scripps Board Recommendation shall not be deemed to be a Change in the Scripps Board Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement.

Section 10.02 No Solicitation; Other Offers

(a) From the date hereof until the Broadcast Merger Effective Time or, if earlier, until this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article 13, except as expressly permitted by this Section 10.02, Journal shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to facilitate or encourage the submission of any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Journal Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with or otherwise cooperate with, or knowingly assist, participate in, facilitate or encourage any effort by, or furnish any information relating to Journal or any of its Subsidiaries, or afford access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of Journal or any of its Subsidiaries to, any Third Party that is seeking to make, or has made, a Journal Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, memorandum of understanding or other similar instrument relating to a Journal Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 10.02(b)) (each, a “Journal Acquisition Agreement”).

any Journal Acquisition Agreement solely in response to a Journal Superior Proposal only if (A) such Journal Superior Proposal did not result from a breach of the provisions of this Section 10.02 by Journal or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) the Journal Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would reasonably likely violate its fiduciary obligations under Applicable Law, (C) without limiting Journal’s obligation under Section 10.02(b)(i)(C), the Journal Board provides written notice to Scripps (a “Notice of Journal Superior Proposal”) advising Scripps that the Journal Board has received a Journal Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Journal Superior Proposal and identifying the Person making such Journal Superior Proposal (and attaching any agreement and all material related documentation providing for such Journal Superior Proposal) and indicating that the Journal Board intends to make a Change in the Journal Board Recommendation, (D) Journal negotiates, and causes its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with Scripps and its Representatives during the Journal Response Window, to the extent Scripps wishes to negotiate, to enable Scripps to make an offer or counteroffer to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements such that it would cause such Journal Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Journal Superior Proposal, (E) if Scripps does not, within five (5) Business Days of its receipt of the Notice of Journal Superior Proposal (the “Journal Response Window”), make an offer or a counteroffer that the Journal Board determines, in its good faith judgment (after having received the advice of a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation) and outside legal counsel to be at least as favorable to the Journal Shareholders as such Journal Superior Proposal; it being understood and agreed that, with respect to clauses (C), (D) and (E) of this Section 10.02(b)(ii), any material amendments to such Journal Superior Proposal, including the financial terms of such Journal Superior Proposal, shall each require the delivery of a new Notice of Journal Superior Proposal and the commencement of a new Journal Response Window; and

(iii) to comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Journal Acquisition Proposal or make any disclosure to Journal’s shareholders required by Applicable Law; provided, that the Journal Board shall not withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Scripps the Journal Board Recommendation except as permitted under subsection (ii) above. For the avoidance of doubt, a “stop, look and listen” or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, an express rejection of any Journal Acquisition Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the Journal Board Recommendation shall not be deemed to be a Change in the Journal Board Recommendation for purposes of this Agreement.

In addition to the foregoing, Journal shall not submit to the vote of the Journal Shareholders any Journal Acquisition Proposal (including any Journal Superior Proposal) other than the Transactions prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. Without limiting Section 10.02(a) and Journal’s notice obligations in Section 10.02(b), (1) Journal will promptly, and in any event within 24 hours, notify Scripps in the event that Journal or any of its Subsidiaries or its or their respective Representatives receives any Journal Acquisition Proposal or any information related thereto, which notification shall include a summary of the material terms and conditions of the Journal Acquisition Proposal and identify the Third Party making the same, and (2) Journal shall keep Scripps reasonably informed of any material developments with respect to any such Journal Acquisition Proposal and any discussions and negotiations with respect to a Journal Superior Proposal permitted pursuant to Section 10.02(b)(i). Journal shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality or similar agreement with any Person that prohibits Journal from providing to Scripps any of the information required to be provided to Scripps under this Section 10.02(b) within the time periods contemplated hereby.

(c) Journal shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations, if any, with any Third Party conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any Journal Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or proposal that may reasonably be expected to lead to a Journal Acquisition Proposal, and shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such Third Party (or its agents or advisors) in possession of confidential information regarding Journal or its Subsidiaries that was furnished by or on behalf of Journal in connection with such activities, discussions or negotiations to promptly return or destroy all such information. Without limiting this Section 10.02, it is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 10.02 by any Representative of Journal or any of its Subsidiaries shall constitute a breach of this Section 10.02 by Journal.

Section 10.03 Intercompany Accounts. Except as set forth on Section 10.03 of the Journal Disclosure Schedule or as provided for in the Tax Matters Agreements, all intercompany accounts between Journal or its Subsidiaries (other than the Journal Newspaper Business), on the one hand, and the Journal Newspaper Entities, on the other hand, as of the Newspaper Merger Effective Time shall be cancelled at the Newspaper Merger Effective Time.

Section 10.06 Journal Shareholders’ Meeting. Journal shall, in accordance with its Organizational Documents and Applicable Law, establish a Record Date for, duly call and give notice of, and convene and hold no later than thirty-five (35) days following the date on which such notice is given, a meeting of the Journal Shareholders (the “Journal Shareholders’ Meeting”) for the purpose of seeking the Journal Shareholder Approval.

No compromise or full or partial settlement of any such Action will be agreed upon without Scripps’s prior written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

If the Closing Date shall not have occurred for any reason within the original effective period of the FCC Consent, and neither party hereto shall have terminated this Agreement pursuant to Article 13, Scripps and Journal shall jointly request extensions of the effective period of the FCC Consent until the Closing Date occurs or this Agreement is otherwise terminated; provided, however, that no such extension of the FCC Consent shall limit the right of either party hereto to exercise such party’s rights under Article 13.

(b) Journal shall prosecute each application for renewal of any Primary Journal FCC License (a “Renewal Application”) that is pending on the date hereof, and shall timely file and prosecute any Renewal Application that is required to be filed by it prior to or on the Closing Date. For each Renewal Application that is pending on the date hereof or that otherwise may become eligible for grant by the FCC prior to the Closing Date, Journal shall, to the extent reasonably necessary to expedite grant by the FCC of that Renewal Application and thereby to facilitate grant of the FCC Application, enter into a tolling, assignment and assumption or similar agreement with the FCC to extend the statute of limitations for the FCC to determine or impose a forfeiture penalty against the relevant Journal Station in connection with (i) any pending complaints that the Journal Station aired programming that contained obscene, indecent or profane material or (ii) any other enforcement matters against the Journal Station with respect to which the FCC may permit Journal to enter into a tolling assignment and assumption or similar agreement. With respect to those Journal Stations for which a Renewal Application is pending or must be filed during the pendency of the FCC Application, to avoid disruption or delay in the processing of the FCC Application, but without limiting Journal’s obligation set out in this Section 11.03(b) to use its reasonable best efforts to pursue the grant of any pending Renewal Application prior to the Closing Date through a tolling or similar agreement with the FCC, Scripps agrees, as part of the FCC Application, to request that the FCC apply its policy permitting the transfer of control of broadcast licenses in transactions involving multiple stations to proceed, notwithstanding the pendency of one or more Renewal

Applications (the “FCC Renewal Policy”). Scripps shall make such representations and agree to such undertakings as are required to be made to invoke the FCC Renewal Policy, including undertakings to assume, as between the parties hereto and the FCC, the position of the applicant before the FCC with respect to any pending Renewal Application and to assume the corresponding regulatory risks relating to any such Renewal Application.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Scripps and Journal each agree to use their respective reasonable best efforts to take promptly any and all steps necessary to eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents under any antitrust or competition law, rule or regulation (including the HSR Act), or any communications or broadcast law, rule or regulation (including the Communications Act and the rules, regulations and written decisions and policies of the FCC promulgated pursuant thereto), that may be required by the FCC, the FTC, the DOJ, any state Attorney General or any other U.S. federal, state or local governmental authority, or any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or competition Governmental Authority, in each case having competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to close the Transactions as promptly as practicable, including committing to or effecting, by consent decree, pocket consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, divestitures or limitations on freedom of action as are required in order to obtain the FCC Consent or the HSR Clearance and to avoid the entry of (or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift) any order that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying the consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.03(c), if any of the consents or approvals (or elimination of impediments) contemplated by the preceding sentence have not been obtained (or eliminated), in each case as of the date that is six (6) months following the date hereof, and if Scripps or Journal, after consultation with Journal or Scripps, as the case may be, determines, or, if at any time after the date hereof, the FCC, the FTC, the DOJ, any state Attorney General or any other U.S. federal, state or local governmental authority, or any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or competition Governmental Authority, has indicated, that a divestiture or other relief is required to obtain the FCC Consent (other than the divestitures set forth at Section 8.14 of the Journal Disclosure Schedule) or the HSR Clearance, or otherwise to remove any impediment or to obtain any required consents under any antitrust or competition law, rule or regulation or under the Communications Laws in connection with the consummation of the Transactions, then Scripps or Journal, as the case may be, shall have the right to provide written notice of such determination or indication to Journal or Scripps, as the case may be (a “Divestiture Notice”). Upon receipt of a Divestiture Notice, Journal or Scripps, as the case may be, shall promptly (and in all respects prior to the End Date) agree to implement or cause to be implemented such divestiture, but conditioned on consummation of the Transactions hereunder. Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, Scripps and Journal will take any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that (i) no requirement for any non-action, consent or approval of FCC, the FTC, the DOJ, any state Attorney General or any other U.S. federal, state or local governmental authority, or any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or competition governmental authority, (ii) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding, and (iii) no other matter relating to any antitrust or competition law or any Communications Law would preclude consummation of the Transactions on or before the End Date.

Section 11.04 Cooperation.  In connection with their obligations pursuant to this Article 11 with respect to pursuing the FCC Consent and the HSR Clearance, Scripps and Journal shall (a) keep each other informed in all material respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any material communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, any Governmental Authority and of any material communication received or given in connection with any Action by a private party, in each case with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, (b) notify each other of all documents filed with, submitted to or received from any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement, the Scripps Stations, the Journal Stations or the Transactions (and provide each other copies of such documents), (c) furnish each other with such information and assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with their preparation of any governmental filing or submission hereunder and (d) reasonably cooperate with each other in connection with and in advance of any filing or submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the Transactions and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry by or before any Governmental Authority relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, including any Action initiated by a private party. Each of Scripps and Journal (i) shall have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with each other on, all information that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, and (ii) shall give the other a reasonable opportunity to attend and participate in meetings and telephone conferences with any such Governmental Authority relating to the foregoing, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority. With regard to any sharing of information between the parties contemplated under this Section 11.04, (A) any disclosure of information shall be done in a manner consistent with Applicable Law, (B) information may be withheld as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client privilege concerns or as necessary to comply with restrictions set forth in Contracts and (C) either party may, as it deems advisable or necessary, reasonably designate any confidential or competitively sensitive information as for “outside counsel only.” Neither Scripps nor Journal shall file any amendment to the FCC Application or, after grant of the FCC Consent, request any modification of the FCC Consent without the consent of the other party hereto, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(d) The indemnification provisions contained in (i) the Tax Matters Agreements (and not Sections 14.02, 14.03 and 14.04) shall apply to any Damages with respect to any Tax liability or Tax asset allocated to any Person pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreements and (ii) the Employee Matters Agreement (and not Sections 14.02, 14.03 and 14.04) shall apply to any obligation from and after the Effective Time of any Person pursuant to the Employee Matters Agreement.

Section 14.03 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) The party hereto seeking indemnification under Section 14.02 (the “Indemnified Party”) agrees to give prompt notice to the party hereto against whom indemnity is sought (the “Indemnifying Party”) of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, Action or proceeding (each, a “Claim”) in respect of which indemnity may be sought under such Section and will provide the Indemnifying Party such information with respect thereto that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure shall have actually materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its option, exercisable within thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice to assume the defense of, at its own expense and by its own counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party), any matter involving the asserted liability of the Indemnified Party (“Asserted Liabilities”), subject to the limitations set forth herein. If the Indemnifying Party shall undertake to compromise, settle or defend any such Asserted Liability, it shall promptly notify the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so, and the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the compromise or settlement of, or defense against, any such Asserted Liability; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Asserted Liability without the written consent of the Indemnified Party unless such settlement releases the Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations with respect to the Asserted Liability and the settlement does not impose injunctive or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party. Notwithstanding an election by the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of such action or proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such action or proceeding at its own expense. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense but shall pay for the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party’s legal counsel, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party, if (i) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (ii) the Indemnified Party has been advised by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, and the Indemnified Party, on the other hand, or (iii) the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to prosecute or defend such claim. If the Indemnified Party shall undertake to compromise, settle or defend any Asserted Liability in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence or after the Indemnifying Party has declined to exercise its option to assume the defense of an Asserted Liability, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of its intention to do so, and the Indemnifying Party agrees to cooperate fully with the Indemnified Party and its counsel in the compromise or settlement of, or defense against, any such Asserted Liability; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall not settle any such Asserted Liability without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(c) Each party hereto shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate, in the defense or prosecution of any Claim by a Third Party and shall furnish or cause to be furnished such records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.

Section 14.04 Calculation of Damages. Any Damages payable by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 14.02 shall be (a) reduced by any proceeds recovered by the Indemnified Party under applicable insurance policies, net of any costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such proceeds, (b) reduced by any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment paid to the Indemnified Party by any Third Party with respect to such Damages, net of any costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such payment and (c) reduced by an amount equal to any net tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnified Party as a consequence of such Damages. If an Indemnified Party receives a payment required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Liability and subsequently receives insurance proceeds, then the Indemnified Party will pay to the Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess of the payment received over the amount of the payment that would have been due if the insurance proceeds had been received, realized or recovered before the payment was made by the Indemnifying Party.

Section 14.05 Release of Pre-Closing Date Claims.

(a) Except as provided in Section 14.05(c), effective as of the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, Newco, for itself and each of its Subsidiaries (including each Newspaper Entity) and their respective Affiliates, successors, assigns, shareholders, directors, officers, members, agents and employees, hereby remises, releases and forever discharges Scripps and Journal and their respective Subsidiaries (other than the Scripps Newspaper Entities and the Journal Newspaper

Entities, respectively), their respective Affiliates, successors, assigns, shareholders, directors, officers, members, agents and employees, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, from any and all Liabilities whatsoever, whether at law or in equity (including any right of contribution), whether arising under any Contract, by operation of law or otherwise, existing or arising from any acts or events occurring or failing to occur or alleged to have occurred or to have failed to occur or any conditions existing or alleged to have existed at or before the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, whether or not known as of the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, including in connection with the Transactions.

(b) Except as provided in Section 14.05(c), effective as of the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, each of Scripps and Journal, for itself and each of its Subsidiaries (other than any Scripps Newspaper Entity or Journal Newspaper Entity) and their respective Affiliates, successors, assigns, shareholders, directors, officers, members, agents and employees, hereby remises, releases and forever discharges each of Newco and its Subsidiaries (including the Scripps Newspaper Entities and Journal Newspaper Entities), their respective Affiliates, successors, assigns, shareholders, directors, officers, members, agents and employees, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, from any and all Liabilities whatsoever, whether at law or in equity (including any right of contribution), whether arising under any Contract, by operation of law or otherwise, existing or arising from any acts or events occurring or failing to occur or alleged to have occurred or to have failed to occur or any conditions existing or alleged to have existed at or before the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, whether or not known as of the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, including in connection with the Transactions.

(c) Nothing contained in Sections 14.05(a) or 14.05(b) shall impair any right of any Person to enforce this Agreement (including the indemnification rights of each party hereto under this Article 14) or any other Transaction Agreement or any Contracts that are specified in Sections 2.05(b) or 3.05(b) as surviving the Closing Date, in each case in accordance with its terms. Nothing contained in Sections 14.05(a) or 14.05(b) shall release any Person from:

(i) any Liability provided in or resulting from any Contract among Scripps or its Subsidiaries or Journal or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Newco or its Subsidiaries (including the Scripps Newspaper Entities and the Journal Newspaper Entities), on the other hand, that is specified in Sections 2.05(b) or 3.05(b) as surviving the Closing Date, or any other Liability specified in such Sections as surviving the Closing Date; or

(ii) any Liability, contingent or otherwise, assumed, transferred, assigned or allocated to Scripps, Journal, Newco, the Scripps Newspaper Entities, the Journal Newspaper Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries in accordance with, or any other Liability of any such Person under, the Transaction Agreements.

(d) If an Indemnified Party receives any payment from an Indemnifying Party in respect of Damages and the Indemnified Party could have recovered all or a part of such Damages from a Third Party based on the underlying claim or demand asserted against it, then such Indemnified Party shall transfer such of its rights to proceed against such Third Party as are necessary to permit such Indemnifying Party to recover from such Third Party the amount of such payment.

Section 14.06 Exclusivity. After the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, this Article 14 (or the Tax Matters Agreements or the Employee Matters Agreement, as the case may be) will provide the exclusive remedy for any claims by or against Newco or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or by or against Scripps, Journal or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, on the other hand, arising as a result of or in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions (other than any remedy provided in any of the other applicable Transaction Agreements), except that nothing herein shall limit the liability of any party hereto for fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

Section 15.03 Amendments and Waivers.

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived prior to the Newspaper Merger Effective Time or Broadcast Merger Effective Time, as the case may be, if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by each party hereto against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided, however, that (a) after receipt of the Scripps Shareholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Applicable Law requires further approval by the shareholders of Scripps without the further approval of such shareholders, (b) after receipt of the Journal Shareholder Approval, there shall be made no amendment that by Applicable Law requires further approval by the shareholders of Journal without the further approval of such shareholders, and (c) except as provided above, no amendment of this Agreement shall require the approval of the shareholders of Scripps or the shareholders of Journal.

(b) No failure or delay by any party hereto in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

Section 15.04 Fees and Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided in any Transaction Agreement (including pursuant to Section 13.03 or 13.04), all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party hereto incurring such fee or expense. Any fees and expenses for which Newco is responsible but that are incurred and must be paid prior to the Newspaper Merger Effective Time shall be paid by Scripps and Journal, with each of Scripps and Journal paying one-half of such fees and expenses.

Section 15.05 Disclosure Schedule References. Any information disclosed in any Section of the Scripps Disclosure Schedule or the Journal Disclosure Schedule shall qualify the correspondingly numbered representation and warranty or covenant of this Agreement and any other representation and warranty or covenant of Scripps or Journal, as applicable, contained in this Agreement to the extent that the relevance of any such disclosure to such other representation and warranty or covenant is reasonably apparent from the content and context of such disclosure. The fact that any item of information is disclosed in any Section of the Scripps Disclosure Schedule or the Journal Disclosure Schedule shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and any dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms “material” or “Material Adverse Effect” or other similar terms in this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly set forth in the applicable Disclosure Schedules. Matters set forth in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected therein. Such additional matters are set forth for informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a similar nature.

Section 15.06 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns except that, following the Broadcast Merger Effective Time, (i) each D&O Indemnified Person is a third party beneficiary of the provisions set forth in Section 11.14, (ii) each Newco Indemnified Party and Scripps Indemnified Party is a third party beneficiary of the indemnification provisions set forth in Article 14 and (iii) each specified beneficiary of the releases set forth in Section 14.05 is a third party beneficiary of such Section.

Section 15.07 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state, except to the extent that the DGCL, ORC, the WBCL and the Wisconsin LLC Act mandatorily apply and govern certain of the Transactions.

Section 15.08 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.

Section 15.09 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement. This Agreement shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and delivered to Scripps and Journal.

Section 15.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement shall automatically terminate at the Broadcast Merger Effective Time. Unless and until the Broadcast Merger Effective Time has occurred, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and survive any termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

Section 15.11 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such a determination, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 15.12 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of any Transaction Agreement was not performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached and that any non-performance or breach of any Transaction Agreement by any party hereto could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone and that the parties hereto would not have any adequate remedy at law. It is accordingly agreed that the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any Transaction Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and of each other Transaction Agreement in any federal or state court without posting any bond or other undertaking, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Section 15.13 Non-Exclusive Jurisdiction. Each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the non-exclusive personal jurisdiction of the state courts of State of New York, County of New York and of the federal courts located in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof), in the event any dispute arises out of any Transaction Agreement or any Transaction and (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court.

Section 15.14 Certain Legal Matters.

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Baker & Hostetler LLP has represented Scripps in connection with the Transactions. The parties hereto hereby consent to the representation by Baker & Hostetler LLP of Scripps or any of its Affiliates in any future matter including post-closing disputes concerning any Transaction Agreement and all Transactions.

(b) The parties hereto acknowledge that Foley & Lardner LLP has represented Journal in connection with the Transactions. The parties hereto hereby consent to the representation by Foley & Lardner LLP of Newco or any of its Affiliates in any future matter including post-closing disputes concerning any Transaction Agreement and all Transactions.

with the Agreement and in compliance with all applicable laws, without waiver, modification or amendment of any material terms or conditions, and that in the course of obtaining any necessary legal, regulatory or third party consents or approvals for the Transactions or such contemplated financings, no delays, limitations, conditions or restrictions will be imposed or actions will be taken that will have an adverse effect on Journal, the Journal Newspaper Business, the Journal Broadcasting Business, Scripps, the Scripps Newspaper Business or the Scripps Broadcasting Business or the expected benefits of the Transactions in any way meaningful to our analysis. Our opinion is necessarily based on economic, market, financial and other conditions and the information made available to us as of the date hereof. Although subsequent developments may affect this opinion, we do not have any obligation to update, revise or reaffirm this opinion.

Wells Fargo Securities has been engaged to act as financial advisor to the Board of Directors of Scripps in connection with the Transactions and will receive a fee for such services, a portion of which will be payable upon delivery of the opinions related to the Transactions and the principal portion of which will be payable upon the consummation of the Transactions. Scripps has also agreed to reimburse certain of Wells Fargo Securities’ expenses and to indemnify Wells Fargo Securities and certain related parties against certain liabilities that may arise out of our engagement.

In that regard, Wells Fargo Securities or our affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing, and in the future may provide, financial services to Scripps and its affiliates, Journal and its affiliates and Newco and its affiliates, respectively, for which Wells Fargo Securities and such affiliates have received and expect to receive fees, including (i) having acted as exclusive financial advisor to Scripps in connection with its acquisition of two television stations from Granite Broadcasting Corp., (ii) having acted as joint lead arranger and joint book-running manager, and a lender, under Scripps’ $275 million amended and restated revolving credit and term loan facility and (iii) having provided or providing certain treasury management services to Scripps and Journal.

In the ordinary course of business, Wells Fargo Securities and our affiliates may actively trade or hold the securities or financial instruments of Scripps, Journal and Newco for our and their own account and for the accounts of customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities or financial instruments.

It is understood that this opinion is for the information and use of the Board of Directors of Scripps (in its capacity as such) in connection with its evaluation of the Transactions and such opinion does not constitute a recommendation to the Board of Directors of Scripps or to any other person or entity in respect of the Transactions or otherwise, including as to how any holder of shares of Scripps Common Voting Shares should vote with respect to the issuance of shares of Scripps Class A Common Shares in the Broadcast Merger pursuant to the Transactions and the Agreement or any other matter.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, our experience as investment bankers, our work described above and other factors we deemed relevant, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, the Broadcast Exchange Ratio pursuant to the Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to Scripps.

Very truly yours,

(2) A dissenter waives his or her right to demand payment under this section unless the dissenter notifies the corporation of his or her demand under sub. (1) in writing within 30 days after the corporation made or offered payment for his or her shares. The notice shall comply with s. 180.0141.

180.1330 Court action.

If the corporation does not bring the special proceeding within the 60−day period, it shall pay each dissenter whose demand remains unsettled the amount demanded.

(2) The corporation shall bring the special proceeding in the circuit court for the county where its principal office or, if none in this state, its registered office is located. If the corporation is a foreign corporation without a registered office in this state, it shall bring the special proceeding in the county in this state in which was located the registered office of the issuer corporation that merged with or whose shares were acquired by the foreign corporation.

(3) The corporation shall make all dissenters, whether or not residents of this state, whose demands remain unsettled parties to the special proceeding. Each party to the special proceeding shall be served with a copy of the petition as provided in s. 801.14.

(4) The jurisdiction of the court in which the special proceeding is brought under sub. (2) is plenary and exclusive. The court may appoint one or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend decision on the question of fair value. An appraiser has the power described in the order appointing him or her or in any amendment to the order. The dissenters are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings.

(a) The amount, if any, by which the court finds the fair value of his or her shares, plus interest, exceeds the amount paid by the corporation.

(b) The fair value, plus accrued interest, of his or her shares acquired on or after the date specified in the dissenter’s notice under s. 180.1322 (2) (c), for which the corporation elected to withhold payment under s. 180.1327.

180.1331 Court costs and counsel fees. (1) (a) Notwithstanding ss. 814.01 to 814.04, the court in a special proceeding brought under s. 180.1330 shall determine all costs of the proceeding, including the reasonable compensation and expenses of appraisers appointed by the court and shall assess the costs against the corporation, except as provided in par. (b).

(b) Notwithstanding ss. 814.01 and 814.04, the court may assess costs against all or some of the dissenters, in amounts that the court finds to be equitable, to the extent that the court finds the dissenters acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith in demanding payment under s. 180.1328.

(2) The parties shall bear their own expenses of the proceeding, except that, notwithstanding ss. 814.01 to 814.04, the court may also assess the fees and expenses of counsel and experts for the respective parties, in amounts that the court finds to be equitable, as follows:
