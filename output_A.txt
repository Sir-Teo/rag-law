**< a name="toc283119_67"></a>PROPOSAL 2: APPROVAL, ON A NON-BINDING, ADVISORY BASIS, OF CERTAIN MERGER-RELATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION **

Section 14A of the Exchange Act, which was enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, requires that we provide stockholders with the opportunity to vote, on a non-binding, advisory basis, on the compensation that will or may become payable by Twitter to our named executive officers in connection with the merger, as disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “ _The Merger—Interests of Twitter’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation_ ,” including the additional disclosures referenced therein that otherwise are disclosed in the section of this proxy statement captioned “ _The Merger—Interests of Twitter’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger_.” 

We are asking our stockholders to approve the compensation that will or may become payable by Twitter to our named executive officers in connection with the merger. These payments are set forth in the section of this proxy statement captioned “ _The Merger—Interests of Twitter’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation_ ” and the accompanying footnotes and additional disclosures referenced therein. The various plans and arrangements pursuant to which these compensation payments may be made generally have previously formed part of Twitter’s overall compensation program for our named executive officers and previously have been disclosed to stockholders as part of the Compensation Discussion and Analysis and related sections of our annual proxy statements. These historical arrangements were adopted and approved by the Compensation Committee of the Twitter Board, which is composed solely of non-employee directors, and are believed to be reasonable and in line with marketplace norms. 

Accordingly, we are seeking approval of the following resolution at the special meeting: 

“RESOLVED, that the stockholders of Twitter, Inc. approve the compensation that will or may become payable to Twitter’s named executive officers in connection with the merger as disclosed pursuant to Item 402(t) of Regulation S-K in the section captioned “The Merger—Interests of Twitter’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Golden Parachute Compensation” in Twitter’s proxy statement for the special meeting.” 

This proposal is not a condition to completion of the merger, and as a non-binding, advisory vote, the result will not be binding on Twitter, the Twitter Board or Parent. Further, the underlying plans and arrangements are contractual in nature and not, by their terms, subject to stockholder approval. Accordingly, regardless of the outcome of the advisory vote, if the merger is consummated our named executive officers will be eligible to receive the compensation that is based on or that otherwise relates to the merger in accordance with the terms and conditions applicable to those payments. 

**The Twitter Board unanimously recommends that you vote “FOR” this proposal.**

**< a name="toc283119_12"></a>Interests of Twitter’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger **

When considering the recommendation of the Twitter Board that you vote to approve the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, you should be aware that our directors and executive officers may have interests in the merger that are different from, or in addition to, your interests as a stockholder. In (1) evaluating and negotiating the merger agreement, (2) approving the merger agreement and the merger and (3) recommending that the merger agreement be adopted by our stockholders, the Twitter Board was aware of and considered these interests to the extent that they existed at the time, among other matters. These interests include the following: 

| • |  |  For our executive officers, the treatment of their Twitter equity-based awards, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “ _The Merger—Interests of Twitter’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards_.”   
---|---|---|---  

| • |  |  For our non-employee directors, the treatment of their Twitter equity-based awards and Twitter options, as described in more detail in the section of this proxy statement captioned “ _The Merger—Interests of Twitter’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger—Treatment of Equity-Based Awards_.”   
---|---|---|---  

| • |  |  The entitlement of each of our executive officers to receive payments and benefits pursuant to Twitter’s Change of Control and Involuntary Termination Policy (which we refer to as the “**severance policy** ”) if, during the period beginning on our change of control (or, in the case of Mr. Agrawal, beginning three months before our change of control) and ending 12 months after our change of control (which we refer to as the “**COC period** ”), Twitter terminates their employment with Twitter for a reason other than “cause,” death or “disability” or they resign for “good reason” (which we refer to as an “**involuntary termination** ”), in each case as set forth in the severance policy. These payments and benefits include:   
---|---|---|---  

| ○ |  |  a lump sum payment equal to 100 percent of base salary;   
---|---|---|---  

| ○ |  |  payment of continuation of coverage premiums under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (which we refer to as “**COBRA** ”) for up to 12 months, or taxable payments in lieu of such payment; and   
---|---|---|---  

| ○ |  |  50 percent (or 100 percent in the case of Mr. Agrawal and Mr. Segal) acceleration of vesting of unvested equity awards (with performance-based vesting deemed achieved at target levels as to that percentage).   
---|---|---|---  

| • |  |  The continued indemnification and insurance coverage for our directors and executive officers from the surviving corporation and Parent under the terms of the merger agreement.

For more information, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “ _The Merger Agreement—Restrictions on Solicitation of Other Acquisition Offers_.” 

Twitter is not entitled to terminate the merger agreement to enter into an agreement for a superior proposal unless it complies with certain procedures in the merger agreement, including engaging in good faith negotiations with Parent during a specified period. If Twitter terminates the merger agreement in order to accept a superior proposal from a third party it must pay a termination fee to Parent.

Except in the case of a knowing and intentional breach of the merger agreement by Mr. Musk, Parent or Acquisition Sub (in which case Twitter will be entitled to seek monetary damages, recovery or award from Mr. Musk, Parent or Acquisition Sub in an amount not to exceed the amount of the termination fee, in the aggregate), Twitter’s right to receive payment from Parent of the termination fee pursuant, will constitute the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Twitter against the Parent, Acquisition Sub and Mr. Musk and his related parties under the merger agreement. 

In addition, under no circumstances can Twitter receive both a grant of specific performance to cause the equity financing to be funded, on the one hand, and payment of the termination fee payable by Parent to Twitter or other monetary damages, remedy or award, on the other hand, and in no event will Twitter be permitted or entitled to receive aggregate monetary damages in excess of the termination fee payable by Parent to Twitter (other than Twitter’s receipt of certain other amounts under the merger agreement). 


**< a name="toc283119_34"></a>Shares Held by Twitter’s Directors and Executive Officers and by Mr. Musk **

As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 1,684,502 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 0.2 percent of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of the record date. Twitter has not been informed that any of our directors and executive officers intend to vote any of their shares of our common stock other than: (1) “**FOR** ” the adoption of the merger agreement; (2) ”**FOR** ” the compensation that will or may become payable by Twitter to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “**FOR** ” the adjournment of the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting. 

As of June 30, 2022, Mr. Musk beneficially holds approximately 9.5 percent of our common stock. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Mr. Musk has agreed to retain and not dispose of, and to vote all of his shares of our common stock in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement. As of the record date, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned and were entitled to vote, in the aggregate, 1,684,502 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 0.2 percent of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of the record date. As of the date of this proxy statement, we have not been informed that any of our directors or officers intend to vote their shares other than in favor of adoption of the merger agreement. All such shares of our common stock held beneficially by

##### 

Mr. Musk, and by our directors and officers (and any shares held by our former directors and officers) as of the record date that are voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement will be counted for purposes of determining whether the proposal to adopt the merger agreement has been approved. Assuming that all such shares of our common stock beneficially held by Mr. Musk, and by our directors and officers as of the record date, are voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, the affirmative vote of stockholders holding an additional 40.2 percent of our common stock is required to adopt the merger agreement. Alternatively, notwithstanding Mr. Musk’s contractual obligation to vote all shares of our common stock beneficially owned by him in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, assuming that all such shares are not voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement but that all shares of our common stock beneficially held by our directors and officers as of the record date are voted in favor of the adoption of the merger agreement, the affirmative vote of stockholders holding an additional 49.8 percent of our common stock would be required to adopt the merger agreement. For additional information regarding beneficial ownership of common stock, see the section of this proxy statement captioned “ _Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management_.” 


**< a name="toc283119_81"></a>Indemnification and Insurance **

In the merger agreement, Parent and Acquisition Sub have agreed that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the merger existing as of the date of the merger agreement in favor of the current or former directors, officers and employees, if any, of Twitter or its subsidiaries (we refer to such persons collectively as the “**indemnified persons** ”) as provided in their respective organizational documents as in effect on the date of the merger agreement, or in any contract, will survive the merger and will continue in full force and effect. The merger agreement provides that the surviving corporation will (and Parent will cause the surviving corporation to) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to the indemnified persons with respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the effective time of the merger (including any matters arising in connection with the merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby), to the fullest extent that Twitter or its subsidiaries would be permitted by applicable law and to the fullest extent required by the organizational documents of Twitter or its subsidiaries as in effect on the date of the merger agreement. Parent has agreed to cause the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other organizational documents of the surviving corporation and its subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to exculpation, indemnification, advancement of expenses and limitation of director, officer and employee liability that are no less favorable to the indemnified persons than those set forth in Twitter’s and its subsidiaries’ organizational documents as of the date of the merger agreement, which provisions thereafter will not, for a period of six years from the effective time of the merger, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the indemnified persons. 

Furthermore, to the fullest extent that Twitter would be permitted by applicable law to do so, Parent will or will cause the surviving corporation to: (1) indemnify and hold harmless each indemnified person against and from any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to (a) any alleged action or omission in such indemnified person’s capacity as a director, officer or employee of Twitter or any of its subsidiaries prior to the effective time of the merger, or (b) the merger agreement or the 

156 

* * *

##### 

transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and (2) pay in advance of the final disposition of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) of any indemnified person upon confirmation by the indemnified of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification applicable to him or her and a customary written undertaking by him or her or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed if it is ultimately determined that the standard of conduct for indemnification was not met. 

For at least six years after the effective time of the merger, (1) Parent will cause the surviving corporation and its other subsidiaries to maintain in full force and effect the coverage provided by the existing directors’ and officers’ liability insurance and fiduciary insurance in effect as of the date of the merger agreement and maintained by Twitter or any of its subsidiaries, or provide substitute policies for Twitter and its current and former directors and officers who are currently covered by such existing D&O insurance policies, in either case, on terms and conditions no less advantageous to the indemnified persons than the existing D&O insurance policies, covering claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred at or prior to the effective time of the merger, including the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, subject to customary limitations on policy premiums, and (2) Parent will not, and will not permit the surviving corporation or its other subsidiaries to, take any action that would prejudice the rights of, or otherwise impede recovery by, the beneficiaries of any such insurance, whether in respect of claims arising before or after the effective time of the merger. In lieu of such insurance, prior to the effective time of the merger, Twitter may purchase a six year “tail” prepaid policy on the terms and conditions described above, in which case Parent will cease to have any obligations to maintain the existing D&O insurance policies. 

For more information, refer to the section of this proxy statement captioned “ _The Merger—Interests of Twitter’s Directors and Executive Officers in the Merger_.” 


**< a name="toc283119_82"></a>Conditions to the Closing of the Merger **

The obligations of Parent, Acquisition Sub and Twitter, as applicable, to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including the following: 

| • |  |  the adoption of the merger agreement by the requisite affirmative vote of our stockholders;   
---|---|---|---  

| • |  |  the expiration or termination of the waiting period applicable to the merger under the HSR Act, and, to the extent applicable, each consent or approval required under any antitrust laws or foreign investment laws in certain specified jurisdictions having been made, obtained or received (or, as applicable, the waiting periods, if any, with respect thereto will have expired or been terminated); and   
---|---|---|---  

| • |  |  the absence of any then-effective law or order enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered into by any governmental authority in certain specified jurisdictions which has the effect of restraining, enjoining, rendering illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the merger, or causing the merger to be rescinded following the consummation thereof.   
---|---|---|---  

The obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the merger are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the following additional conditions, any of which may be waived by Parent:

As described above, it is a condition to the obligations of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the merger that the SEC Filings Representation is accurate as of the effective time of the merger (or the date in respect of which the SEC Filings Representation was specifically made, as applicable). The failure of the SEC Filings Representation to be accurate, in itself, would be relevant to Twitter’s ability to satisfy the applicable closing conditions to the merger only if such failure impacted Twitter’s ability, at the closing of the merger, to “bring down” the accuracy of the SEC Filings Representation in a manner that would result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Twitter stands behind the accuracy of its public disclosures, including with respect to its estimates of false or spam accounts.

**< a name="toc283119_33"></a>Vote Required; Abstentions and Broker Non-Votes **

Approval of the proposal to adopt the merger agreement requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock as of the record date. Adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders is a condition to the closing of the merger.****

Approval, on a non-binding, advisory basis, of the compensation that will or may become payable by Twitter to our named executive officers in connection with the merger requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. 

Approval of the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares of our common stock present in person or represented by proxy at the special meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. 

If a stockholder abstains from voting, that abstention will have the same effect as if the stockholder voted: (1) “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement; (2) “AGAINST” the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, compensation that will or may become payable by Twitter to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; and (3) “AGAINST” the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting. Abstentions will be counted as present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists. 

A “broker non-vote” generally occurs when a bank, broker or other nominee holding shares on your behalf does not vote on a proposal because the bank, broker or other nominee has not received your voting instructions and lacks discretionary power to vote your shares. We do not expect any “broker non-votes” at the special meeting, but if there are any, they will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present. If there are broker non-votes, each broker non-vote will count as a vote “AGAINST” the proposal to adopt the merger agreement, but will have no effect on: (1) the proposal to approve, on a non-binding, advisory basis, the compensation that will or may become payable by Twitter to our named executive officers in connection with the merger; or (2) the proposal to adjourn the special meeting, from time to time, to a later date or dates, if necessary or appropriate, to solicit additional proxies if there are insufficient votes to adopt the merger agreement at the time of the special meeting. 


**< a name="toc283119_73"></a>Paying Agent, Exchange Fund and Exchange and Payment Procedures **

Prior to the closing of the merger, Parent will designate a reputable bank or trust company (which we refer to as the “**paying agent** ”), the identity and terms of appointment of which to be reasonably acceptable to Twitter to make payments of the merger consideration to our stockholders. At or prior to the effective time of the merger, Parent will deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the paying agent cash constituting an amount equal to the aggregate merger consideration in accordance with the merger agreement. 

As promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event not later than two business days) following the effective time of the merger, the surviving corporation will cause the paying agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the effective time of the merger represented outstanding shares of our common stock (1) a letter of transmittal, which will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the paying agent, and which will be in the form and have such other provisions as Parent and Twitter may reasonably specify and (2) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates in exchange for merger consideration. Any holder of book-entry shares will not be required to deliver a certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to receive the merger consideration with respect to such book-entry shares. Upon surrender of a certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry share for cancellation to the paying agent, together with, in 

141 

* * *

##### 

the case of certificates, a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, or, in the case of book-entry shares, receipt of an “agent’s message” by the paying agent (it being understood that holders of book-entry shares will be deemed to have surrendered such book-entry shares upon receipt of an “agent’s message” with respect to such book-entry shares), and such other customary evidence of surrender as the paying agent may reasonably require, the holder of such certificate or book-entry share will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the merger consideration for each share of our common stock formerly represented by such certificate or book-entry share on the later to occur of (a) the effective time of the merger or (b) the paying agent’s receipt of such certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry share, and the certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or book-entry share so surrendered will be canceled. The amount of any per share price paid to our stockholders will not include interest and may be reduced by any applicable withholding taxes. 

Any cash deposited with the paying agent that remains undistributed to the holders of the certificates or book-entry shares for one year following the effective time of the merger will be returned to the surviving corporation upon written demand, and any of our stockholders as of immediately prior to the merger who have not theretofore complied with the exchange procedures in the merger agreement will thereafter look only to the surviving corporation as a general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for the merger consideration in respect thereof (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws). None of the paying agent, Parent, Acquisition Sub, Twitter or the surviving corporation will be liable to any person with respect to any cash amounts held by the paying agent delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

In the event that any share certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, of that fact by the person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the paying agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the per share price to such holder. 


**< a name="toc283119_61"></a>Regulatory Approvals Required for the Merger **

**_General Efforts_**

Under the merger agreement, Parent, Acquisition Sub and Twitter agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and to cause the conditions to the merger to be satisfied, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: 

| • |  |  the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, consents and approvals from governmental authorities necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with governmental authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any governmental authority necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger;   
---|---|---|---  

| • |  |  the obtaining of all other necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties;   
---|---|---|---  

| • |  |  the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings through the termination date, whether judicial or administrative, challenging the merger agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, performed or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other governmental authority vacated or reversed; and   
---|---|---|---  

| • |  |  the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the merger and any other transactions to be performed or consummated by such party in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement and to carry out fully the purposes of the merger agreement.   
---|---|---|---  

Mr. Musk, Parent and Acquisition Sub have further agreed to, subject to the terms of the merger agreement, take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents, approvals or waivers (or, as applicable, expiration or termination of the waiting periods with respect thereto) under any antitrust laws, foreign investment laws or other law that may be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local governmental authority, in each case, with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, as promptly as practicable, except that none of Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their affiliates are obligated under the merger agreement to (i) propose, take, or agree to take any actions that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the business, assets, or financial condition of Twitter and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) propose, negotiate, effect or agree to, the sale, divestiture, lease, license, hold separate, transfer, or disposition of, or any restriction on the freedom of action with respect to, any assets, business, or equity holdings of, or held or controlled directly or indirectly by, Mr. Musk or any affiliate of Parent (other than Parent, Acquisition Sub or Twitter after giving effect to the merger and subject to the restrictions set forth in this paragraph). 

The obligations of Twitter, Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the merger are subject to, among other conditions, the expiration of any waiting period (and any extension thereof) applicable to the merger under the HSR Act and the receipt of consents or approvals that are material and required or advisable, in the view of Parent and Twitter, under applicable antitrust laws and foreign investment laws of certain specified jurisdictions (which we collectively refer to as the “**specified regulatory laws** ”) or, as applicable, the waiting periods with respect thereto shall have expired or been terminated, 

128 

* * *

##### 

to the extent applicable. In addition, additional consents and approvals under applicable antitrust laws, foreign investment laws and other laws of other jurisdictions may be sought pursuant to the obligations described above if Parent and Twitter determine a filing, submission or notification is material and required or advisable in such jurisdiction or if regulators in such a jurisdiction open an investigation regarding the merger. 

**_HSR Act; Competition Laws and Foreign Investment Laws_**

_HSR Act_

Under the HSR Act, the merger cannot be completed until Parent and Twitter file a Notification and Report Form with the Federal Trade Commission (which we refer to as the “**FTC** ”) and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (which we refer to as the “**DOJ** ”), and the applicable waiting period has expired or been terminated. A transaction notifiable under the HSR Act may not be completed until the expiration of a 30-calendar day waiting period following the parties’ filing of their respective HSR Act notification forms or the early termination of the waiting period. The parties filed a notification and report form with the FTC and DOJ pursuant to the HSR Act on May 3, 2022\. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired at 11:59 p.m., Eastern time, on June 2, 2022. 

At any time before or after consummation of the merger, notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, the FTC or the DOJ could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable, including seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger, seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties or requiring the parties to license, or hold separate, assets or terminate existing relationships and contractual rights. At any time before or after the completion of the merger, and notwithstanding the termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, any state or the District of Columbia could take such action under the antitrust laws as it deems necessary or desirable. Such action could include seeking to enjoin the completion of the merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of Twitter or Parent. Private parties may also seek to take legal action under the antitrust laws under certain circumstances. 

_United Kingdom – Competition Laws_

Specifically, the completion of the merger is subject to obtaining a favorable outcome from the United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (which we refer to as the “**CMA** ”) either by, in response to an informal briefing paper submitted by the parties, (i) the CMA indicating that it has no further questions about the merger; or (ii) if the CMA decides to investigate the merger, the CMA approving the merger (either unconditionally or conditional upon certain remedies). Upon its commencement of a merger investigation, the CMA has 40 working days in which to complete its initial Phase I review. At the end of Phase I, the CMA must confirm whether it has a reasonable belief that there is a realistic prospect that the merger will lessen competition substantially. If so, the CMA must refer the merger to a Phase II review, unless adequate remedies are offered by the parties within five working days of the CMA’s Phase I decision. Where Phase I remedies are offered, the CMA must decide whether to accept the remedies “in principle” within 10 working days of the Phase I decision and must take a final decision on whether to accept the remedies within 50 working days of the Phase I decision, subject to a possible 40 working day extension at the CMA’s discretion. If a Phase II investigation is launched, the CMA has 24 weeks, extendable by up to eight weeks at the CMA’s discretion if it considers there are special reasons for doing so, to decide if the merger should be prohibited or approved conditional on remedies. The parties submitted an informal briefing paper to the CMA on May 16, 2022. In response to this briefing paper, on May 24, 2022, the CMA notified the parties that it requires no further information on the merger. Notwithstanding this notification, the CMA is not precluded from asking further questions or commencing a merger investigation at a later stage if new information comes to light. The CMA may open a merger investigation at any point up until four months following the closing of the merger. 

129 

* * *

##### 

_United Kingdom – Foreign Investment Laws_

If the merger is a “notifiable acquisition” under the United Kingdom’s National Security and Investment Act 2021 (which we refer to as the “**NSI Act** ”), the completion of the merger is subject to obtaining a favorable outcome under the NSI Act either by: (i) the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (who we refer to as the “**Secretary of State** ”) confirming that no further action will be taken in relation to the merger under the NSI Act; or (ii) the Secretary of State making a final order in relation to the merger under the NSI Act that permits the merger to be completed subject to the provisions of such final order (and, to the extent relevant, all conditions, provisions or obligations contained in such final order necessary for completion of the merger having been satisfied or complied with).

On June 7, 2022, Parent’s legal representative submitted a mandatory notification regarding the merger to the Investment Security Unit (which we refer to as the “**ISU** ”) within the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy pursuant to the NSI Act. On June 9, 2022, the ISU notified Parent’s legal representative that it had accepted the mandatory notification for review. On July 13, 2022, the ISU notified Parent’s legal representative and Twitter UK Limited that the Secretary of State has determined that he will be taking no further action in relation to the merger under the NSI Act. 

_Foreign Competition Laws and Foreign Investment Laws_

Under the merger agreement, the merger cannot be completed until all consents, approvals and filings that are mutually agreed by Parent and Twitter, acting reasonably, to be (1) material and (2) required or advisable under specified regulatory laws have been obtained or deemed to be obtained. The parties must observe mandatory waiting periods and/or obtain the necessary approvals, clearance, consents or no-actions (if and when mutually agreed by Parent and Twitter under the criteria set forth above) under the specified regulatory laws. 

**As of the date of this proxy statement, all regulatory clearances and approvals required to complete the merger under the merger agreement have been obtained. Adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders is the only remaining approval or regulatory condition to completing the merger under the merger agreement.**

Beyond the actions required under the specified regulatory laws, the merger agreement states that the parties may make additional regulatory filings that are mutually agreed to by Parent and Twitter, acting reasonably, to be material and either required or advisable under any antitrust laws or foreign investment laws with respect to the merger. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, the submission of additional regulatory filings under laws other than the specified regulatory laws will not create additional conditions to the consummation of the merger. 

**_Other Regulatory Approvals_**

One or more governmental bodies may impose a condition, restriction, qualification, requirement or limitation when it grants the necessary approvals and consents to the merger. Such governmental bodies – including those in jurisdictions outside of those responsible for the specified regulatory laws – may also assert the right to enjoin or nullify certain legal effects of the transaction, both in those cases in which their conditions, restrictions, qualifications, requirements or limitations are not accepted and in other cases. Any one of these requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the completion – or reduce the anticipated benefits – of the merger. Third parties may also seek to intervene in the regulatory process or litigate to enjoin or overturn regulatory approvals, which actions could significantly impede or even preclude obtaining required regulatory approvals.

**< a name="toc283119_83"></a>Termination of the Merger Agreement **

The merger agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the effective time of the merger, whether before or after the adoption of the merger agreement by our stockholders (except as otherwise provided in the merger agreement), in the following ways: 

| • |  |  by mutual written agreement of Twitter and Parent;

---|---|---  

| o |  prior to the effective time of the merger, any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction has enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law or order or taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining, rendering illegal or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, and such law or order or other action has become final and non-appealable, except, in each case, that the right to terminate will not be available to any party (1) that has failed to use the efforts required by the merger agreement to remove such law, order or other action, or (2) if the issuance of such law or order or taking of such action was primarily due to the failure of such party, and, in the case of Parent, the failure of Acquisition Sub or Mr. Musk, to perform any of its obligations under the merger agreement; or

In the event that the merger agreement is terminated pursuant to the termination rights above, written notice thereof will be given to the other party or parties specifying the provisions of the merger agreement pursuant to which the termination was made, and the merger agreement will become null and void and of no effect without liability of any party thereto (or any of its representatives), and all rights and obligations of any party thereto will cease, except certain sections of the merger agreement will survive the termination of the merger agreement, in each case in accordance with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, no termination of the merger agreement will relieve any party from any liability or damages resulting from any knowing and intentional breach of the merger agreement prior to the termination of the merger agreement, in which case the aggrieved party will be entitled to all rights and remedies available at law or in equity.
